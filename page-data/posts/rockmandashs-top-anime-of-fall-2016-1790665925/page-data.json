After coming off of the fantastic winter and spring seasons of anime, one may\n  get their hopes up for summer... but dreams remained dreams as they got meh. Like most people, in my opinion, the Fall\n  2016 season of anime wasn&#x2019;t all that great: while it had it&#x2019;s greats (the top is STACKED) there were very few shows\n  that compel you to watch every week. Basically this list was pretty much what I actually finished this season, as many\n  shows compelled me to keep on watching. Disappointing, but everything has its ups and downs.<br></p>\n<hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h109878\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>Rules\n</h2>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"djdsbz9mhyuvwkid92kt\" title=\"djdsbz9mhyuvwkid92kt\" src=\"/static/4758c7a310fd473a2e52d38fa4960db7/fcda8/djdsbz9mhyuvwkid92kt.png\" srcset=\"/static/4758c7a310fd473a2e52d38fa4960db7/12f09/djdsbz9mhyuvwkid92kt.png 148w,\n/static/4758c7a310fd473a2e52d38fa4960db7/e4a3f/djdsbz9mhyuvwkid92kt.png 295w,\n/static/4758c7a310fd473a2e52d38fa4960db7/fcda8/djdsbz9mhyuvwkid92kt.png 590w,\n/static/4758c7a310fd473a2e52d38fa4960db7/efc66/djdsbz9mhyuvwkid92kt.png 885w,\n/static/4758c7a310fd473a2e52d38fa4960db7/c83ae/djdsbz9mhyuvwkid92kt.png 1180w,\n/static/4758c7a310fd473a2e52d38fa4960db7/e515d/djdsbz9mhyuvwkid92kt.png 1430w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">My rules of this list are simple: if it aired/released this season, it can go on\n  this list. I don&#x2019;t see the point in only giving a show one chance during it&#x2019;s airing season, and this is my list so\n  I&#x2019;ll list my favorite shows regardless of what season it started on. If this means that one show hogs the top spot for\n  2 seasons, than good for that show! If it&#x2019;s an OVA or movie that came out during the duration of the season I fell in\n  love with, then it may be there. Also, I think that the seasonal split is arbitrary and unnecessary, so it&#x2019;s\n  completely gone here. Sorry about that, but that&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;m doing it.<br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Just an FYI,\n  the placement of the show in the list is mostly based on my experience and enjoyment of the work, so if you&#x2019;re\n  wondering why something isn&#x2019;t where you think it should be or you can&#x2019;t really tell via the justification, that&#x2019;s\n  probably why. Keep in mind, just because a show is lower on the list doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s bad - all of these are great,\n  and a lower placement isn&#x2019;t a mark against the show, at this point it&#x2019;s nearly all personal preference.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h109879\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>Honorable Mention: <em>Shelter</em></h2> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fzQ6gRAEoy0\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"fzQ6gRAEoy0\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://fzQ6gRAEoy0\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-fzQ6gRAEoy0\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Anime Made By:</strong> Porter Robinson, A-1 Pictures<br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Genre: </strong>Anime, Music Video</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Summary: </strong><em>Shelter</em> is a music video for the song &#x201C;Shelter&#x201D;, a collaborative effort of western artists Porter Robinson and Madeon.

Though his new job isn&#x2019;t physically as demanding as a 15km bike ride, Daisuke&#x2019;s new job is mentally taxing due to his quirky co-workers.

It&#x2019;s a great comedy show surrounding the Waganaria store, and while the main cast is gone from <em>WWW.Working!!</em>, the comedy is still here, as well as everything else that comes from this show. That is, being one of the most amusing and engaging comedy shows with wacky characters and wacky hijinks. I&#x2019;d actually argue that I enjoyed <em>www.Working!! </em>even more than the original <em>Working!! </em>because of the new cast having a (personally) less frustrating dynamic than in the past.

At 23, he&#x2019;s not the best or the youngest athlete, but he&#x2019;s not ready to give up either. Yuri returns to his hometown to try and get back in touch with why he loves skating. After a video of Yuri practicing a routine from his longtime idol, prodigy skater Viktor Niforikov, is leaked to the web, Viktor is inspired to shake up his own life and mentor his fan. With Viktor as his new coach, Yuri is challenged to find his own, bold style after a career of living cautiously. But to come out on top, he&#x2019;ll have to face another Yuri - 15 year old wunderkind Yuri Plisetsky - who isn&#x2019;t too happy about someone else winning Viktor&#x2019;s attention. - <em>Plot Summary from the </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga=\"[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://anitay.kinja.com/the-17-anime-of-autumn-2016-you-should-be-watching-1789451240&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]\" href=\"http://anitay.kinja.com/the-17-anime-of-autumn-2016-you-should-be-watching-1789451240\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>17 Anime of Autumn 2016 You Should Be Watching Article</em></a></span>&#xA0; </p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Ah, <em>Yuri on Ice</em>.

I particularly enjoyed the way it handled exposition and it&#x2019;s OP/EDs were great too.
