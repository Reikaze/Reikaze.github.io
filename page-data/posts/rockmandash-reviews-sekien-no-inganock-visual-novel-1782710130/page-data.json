Is it to make you absorbed into another\n  world, is it to engage you into an interesting narrative, or is it just to make you have a great time? There are all\n  things that a Visual Novel should strive for, but when a work has all 3, you have a masterpiece on your hands,\n  something beautiful, entrancing, amazing. <em>Sekien no Inganock</em>, the second game in the <em>What a\n    Beautiful </em>series by Liar Soft is such a game, but this work is not without its faults, a flawed masterpiece.\n</p>\n<div class=\"bxm4mm-2 hKBnez js_video-sticky__top-limit\"></div>\n<div class=\"bxm4mm-4 fQqUFt\"></div></div>\n<div class=\"bxm4mm-1 gKeXmA js_video-sticky-trigger\"></div>\n<div class=\"bxm4mm-0 jRTmst instream-native-video instream-permalink js_video-sticky-target instream-native-video--mobile\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"bxm4mm-3 eCMXYG js_video-sticky__bottom-limit\"></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Before we start though, I\n  need to say that if any of you are worried about the fact that <em>Sekien no Inganock</em> is the second game in the\n  <em>What a Beautiful</em> series, don&#x2019;t be. Yes this is the second game in the series, but from what I&#x2019;ve heard (I&#x2019;ve\n  only played <em>Inganock </em>so far) this is the best to start at as the first game in the series is nowhere near as\n  good as others like this game, none of the stories are directly related, and this is the first one translated to\n  English. If there&#x2019;s a starting point in this series, this would be it, and from my experience it was a fantastic\n  starting point.</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.81081081081081%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAIAAADXZGvcAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAeUlEQVQI1w3K2Q6CMBQEUP7/mzBixBCqZZGthcot3Uypog98APdlkpk5Eel01iwnMsVkSugrb1XJLdiNMsOXcO/1tYLzQ6QloLnVcCnmanR0MKRV0VM4FNiRjio04i3dFn47Lsb/mVx78Ez6mtuCGXwxZ/sV+jOAPwADQWYvM66IIwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"blqnmqm4vc1qhvngb6uo\" title=\"blqnmqm4vc1qhvngb6uo\" src=\"/static/8dbe4922fa63df0a421eceeb1a6e2ee7/fcda8/blqnmqm4vc1qhvngb6uo.png\" srcset=\"/static/8dbe4922fa63df0a421eceeb1a6e2ee7/12f09/blqnmqm4vc1qhvngb6uo.png 148w,\n/static/8dbe4922fa63df0a421eceeb1a6e2ee7/e4a3f/blqnmqm4vc1qhvngb6uo.png 295w,\n/static/8dbe4922fa63df0a421eceeb1a6e2ee7/fcda8/blqnmqm4vc1qhvngb6uo.png 590w,\n/static/8dbe4922fa63df0a421eceeb1a6e2ee7/5a190/blqnmqm4vc1qhvngb6uo.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"g2uimo4tcypexs6hlqfj\" title=\"g2uimo4tcypexs6hlqfj\" src=\"/static/7f2096abd19a40d4e390ab39000fea50/1c72d/g2uimo4tcypexs6hlqfj.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/7f2096abd19a40d4e390ab39000fea50/a80bd/g2uimo4tcypexs6hlqfj.jpg 148w,\n/static/7f2096abd19a40d4e390ab39000fea50/1c91a/g2uimo4tcypexs6hlqfj.jpg 295w,\n/static/7f2096abd19a40d4e390ab39000fea50/1c72d/g2uimo4tcypexs6hlqfj.jpg 590w,\n/static/7f2096abd19a40d4e390ab39000fea50/4b190/g2uimo4tcypexs6hlqfj.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Immersion:</strong> While it may seem like a buzz word to you, when\nyou’re trying to explain an experience, the word immersion becomes more than that, a necessary part of the discussion\nitself. This is due to the fact that the aspects of immersion like the feeling of being entranced in a world or being\nhooked into the narrative of certain characters are real aspects that play a significant role in your experience. In\n<em>Sekien no Inganock</em>, the way that they handle this aspect may just be the first thing that will catch your\nattention, being one of the defining traits of this game<em>. </em>This is because this visual novel absolutely nails\nthe feeling of being in another world as every attribute of the work like serve to create one amazing and cohesive\nexperience, allowing you to lose hours without noticing it. This all starts with the interesting premise, as game\nsucks you into the bizarre and unusual city of Inganock, a city located in a steampunk world isolated from the rest of\nthe world due to the infinite fog that surrounds the city. The source of the infinite fog? A great accident that\noccurred 10 years before our world started, an accident that caused 41 “Creatures” to kill massive amounts of people\nwhile spreading mutations and diseases throughout the city. In the story we follow, this results in a strict hierarchy\nof society with the rich trying to isolate themselves and a slum full of people that are mutated to be part human part\nanimal and many diseases that can’t be cured with traditional means. We see all sorts of these as we follow Crack\ndoctor Gii and the enigmatic Kia as they travel to help as much people as they can while managing to get in the center\nof the events that dictate this crazy city.<br/></p></p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"ddiwmbvq2tojyfvubfke\" title=\"ddiwmbvq2tojyfvubfke\" src=\"/static/55bfd23a878bc49dcd206aba43086812/1c72d/ddiwmbvq2tojyfvubfke.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/55bfd23a878bc49dcd206aba43086812/a80bd/ddiwmbvq2tojyfvubfke.jpg 148w,\n/static/55bfd23a878bc49dcd206aba43086812/1c91a/ddiwmbvq2tojyfvubfke.jpg 295w,\n/static/55bfd23a878bc49dcd206aba43086812/1c72d/ddiwmbvq2tojyfvubfke.jpg 590w,\n/static/55bfd23a878bc49dcd206aba43086812/4b190/ddiwmbvq2tojyfvubfke.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><em>Sekien no Inganock</em> uses this interesting presence to tell you a tale of\na dystopian fantasy, that is so distinct and unique that you can’t help but be fascinated with what this work has to\noffer. The city is in an absolutely horrible shape, and this story gets you engaged and immersed into this city to the\npoint that it almost feels like you live there. It’s really easy to get invested, getting you curious about the world,\ncurious about the characters, curious about everything it has to offer. How does it do this? Through excellent world\nbuilding and prose, in a fashion that reminds me of Tolkien, creating a mystical and engaging world that’s unlike\nanything else you have seen. We experience the story through the eyes of Gii, but this story is both a story about the\ncharacters that participate in it and the city itself, handled in a way that gets you invested in what it has to\noffer. <em>Sekien no Inganock </em>may not seem to be your traditional Tolkien-esque high fantasy, here is no doubt in\nmy mind that the world that exists in is equally as fantastical, and just as amazing. How many times can you say that\nyou’ve played a game that has transplanted you into an immersive, engaging world that is totally unlike anything\nyou’ve seen? Well, this game offers it, and it’s one of the few that do so. Personally speaking, It’s something I look\nfor whenever I play a game, and whenever it’s this prominent, I can’t help fall in love.</p></p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"njtnlewqivm9gr534mri\" title=\"njtnlewqivm9gr534mri\" src=\"/static/22b539dbb61582b8a436bf619c0d37d3/1c72d/njtnlewqivm9gr534mri.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/22b539dbb61582b8a436bf619c0d37d3/a80bd/njtnlewqivm9gr534mri.jpg 148w,\n/static/22b539dbb61582b8a436bf619c0d37d3/1c91a/njtnlewqivm9gr534mri.jpg 295w,\n/static/22b539dbb61582b8a436bf619c0d37d3/1c72d/njtnlewqivm9gr534mri.jpg 590w,\n/static/22b539dbb61582b8a436bf619c0d37d3/4b190/njtnlewqivm9gr534mri.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Just as prominent as the way they meticulously construct the world is the\nfantastic handling of language, with beautiful and captivating probably being the easiest way to describe the prose of\nthe work, the style everything is said. The word choice, the sentence structure, the way that the words capture the\nessence of the situation, all of this is absolutely fantastic... but the writing of the work isn’t perfect, a problem\nseemingly coming out of nowhere to ruin a nearly perfect work. This is because when dealing with writing in a work,\nthere are two main aspects that affect your experience: the narrative and the prose. In Liar soft’s efforts to make a\nbeautiful work of literature, they focus more on the artistic merits of the work over one’s experience, the narrative\nstruggles. From a repetitive structure that makes a large chunk of the game feel like filler, and a lack of\nexplanation about very important aspects of the story, and an ending that doesn’t provide any closure (<span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga='[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"http://amaterasu.tindabox.net/webnovel/Inganock%20Webnovel%20Files/ing_novel0201kgpb.html\",{\"metric25\":1}]]' href=\"http://amaterasu.tindabox.net/webnovel/Inganock%20Webnovel%20Files/ing_novel0201kgpb.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">though the web novels over at Amaterasu do help a bit</a></span>) leads to the story as a\nwhole being not the most amazing to experience. It has its strong points like great character interactions and strong\ncharacter focused stories that make an impact early on, but as an experience as a whole, it could be better. This is\nthe type of work that usually wouldn’t be my cup of tea, but even though this work is oriented in such a way, the\nstrong points of the work outweigh the negatives to create a compelling, engaging, beautiful work. They crafted an\namazing work that compels you to go on thanks to the interesting character reactions, and the amazing world, but the\nanticipation it builds thanks to it’s quality package just doesn’t deliver in the end. Overall though, the experience\nwas pretty great thanks to the immersion and prose, but the story itself lets the writing a bit down. I can’t feel\nleft a bit disappointed because of it, which is a shame.</p></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Also, it&#x2019;s worth noting that this is an Eroge (thanks Japan), and while I think the\n  story probably could have been done better without it because they can be jarring, they actually are integrated into\n  the story, adding to the relations of the characters. Its inclusion makes it harder to take seriously as a work of art\n  as it tries to be, but at least it&#x2019;s used well.</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 10.81081081081081%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAIAAADXZGvcAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAfElEQVQI1x3L0QqCMBhAYd//dSLoNkMLDcU1t1DbdMV0JYoOc4gwfzxX5+ZzuOz0ZL6dPnr04KaXmAVYXFF1jpgbsRuu7vTjJSU8YerkP5NMjpMZ9AzQ6fXfWmuWlXDlozJMRS5+gFEuH0Utmh6/mrod4WU7hORNubJ7ADehxWkjXcU4TAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"snyikmes5zw6ra4sdp27\" title=\"snyikmes5zw6ra4sdp27\" src=\"/static/1459de91a183c42251fa529693e180bb/fcda8/snyikmes5zw6ra4sdp27.png\" srcset=\"/static/1459de91a183c42251fa529693e180bb/12f09/snyikmes5zw6ra4sdp27.png 148w,\n/static/1459de91a183c42251fa529693e180bb/e4a3f/snyikmes5zw6ra4sdp27.png 295w,\n/static/1459de91a183c42251fa529693e180bb/fcda8/snyikmes5zw6ra4sdp27.png 590w,\n/static/1459de91a183c42251fa529693e180bb/5a190/snyikmes5zw6ra4sdp27.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"nv96ig9eidlaj6ell3eg\" title=\"nv96ig9eidlaj6ell3eg\" src=\"/static/e4b4be48eb247de24fd1ffd99f6117dd/1c72d/nv96ig9eidlaj6ell3eg.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/e4b4be48eb247de24fd1ffd99f6117dd/a80bd/nv96ig9eidlaj6ell3eg.jpg 148w,\n/static/e4b4be48eb247de24fd1ffd99f6117dd/1c91a/nv96ig9eidlaj6ell3eg.jpg 295w,\n/static/e4b4be48eb247de24fd1ffd99f6117dd/1c72d/nv96ig9eidlaj6ell3eg.jpg 590w,\n/static/e4b4be48eb247de24fd1ffd99f6117dd/4b190/nv96ig9eidlaj6ell3eg.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">If the writing was art, the art… is art, with your screen being a beautiful\ncanvas waiting to be filled by drawings that draw you in. Just looking at the art can make an impression on you, and\ncombined into a work that is focused on immersion and world building, the art stands loud and proud being absolutely\nbeautiful. The work feels ethereal, out of this world, a beautiful and engaging imagining of a horrific world that\ncaptures your attention regardless of whether you want to or not. Liar soft and especially some of the games in the\n<em>What a Beautiful</em> series has an art style that is ethereal and lively, with sharp lines, over emphasized with\nbright colors that looks like art, looking like a watercolor masterpiece at one moment and a work of art straight out\nof a sketchbook in another. There’s nothing quite like the art style that they present in this work, and it all helps\nto create a work that’s out of this world. Add in great character designs, and this game can look great. It’s a unique\nart style though, and you may not be a big fan of it at the beginning, but when it’s used well, it can really grow on\nyou. Combine that with one of the best scores in the game, and you’re left with a distinct and unique combination that\nmake this game something special.</p></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM has-video media-large embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLUrGKC0_GzHhTyZL_Clee2gbTurrkyJ5M\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"PLUrGKC0_GzHhTyZL_Clee2gbTurrkyJ5M\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://PLUrGKC0_GzHhTyZL_Clee2gbTurrkyJ5M\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-PLUrGKC0_GzHhTyZL_Clee2gbTurrkyJ5M\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">With 18 tracks to this game&#x2019;s name and a length of 10-30 hours, you may think this soundtrack isn&#x2019;t anything special, but if you asked me to make a shortlist of VNs with a phenomenal soundtrack, this game would probably be on that, with a soundtrack that draws you into a beautiful world, a soundtrack that captures the emotion of the work extremely well, being elegant, memorable, beautiful, otherworldly, and a joy to listen to. I have nothing but positive things to say about this score, sounding great and being well executed in the game, fitting every situation the game calls for. It adds that extra layer of immersion into the game and it really is the stepping stone that transplants you into the game.
