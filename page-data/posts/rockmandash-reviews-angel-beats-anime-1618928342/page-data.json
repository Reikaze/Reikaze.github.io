It&#x2019;s a Key work without slice of life, character development, an interesting\n  cast; Without those, all you are left with is a hollow show tries to be as good as the others, but it inevitably fails\n  at doing anything well. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Almost all of this stems from the fact that Key and PA Works didn&#x2019;t have enough\n  money to make a 24-26 episode show, so they took that script made for 24-26 episodes, and turned it into a 13 episode\n  show. If you compress a 24 episode script into a 13 episode show, It&#x2019;s inevitable that things will be sacrificed...\n  but what&#x2019;s sacrificed in<em> Angel Beats</em> is what separates Key works from the others; it sacrifices what they are\n  good at, to make a sub-par show overall. It has bad pacing, a cast that screams wasted potential, and a rushed plot.\n</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1248126401646502214\" title=\"1248126401646502214\" src=\"/static/28afb866a2c650fd11e25be2f9a3d299/1c72d/1248126401646502214.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/28afb866a2c650fd11e25be2f9a3d299/a80bd/1248126401646502214.jpg 148w,\n/static/28afb866a2c650fd11e25be2f9a3d299/1c91a/1248126401646502214.jpg 295w,\n/static/28afb866a2c650fd11e25be2f9a3d299/1c72d/1248126401646502214.jpg 590w,\n/static/28afb866a2c650fd11e25be2f9a3d299/a8a14/1248126401646502214.jpg 885w,\n/static/28afb866a2c650fd11e25be2f9a3d299/fbd2c/1248126401646502214.jpg 1180w,\n/static/28afb866a2c650fd11e25be2f9a3d299/eea4a/1248126401646502214.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">You might be thinking (or not... probably not) that because of the budget issues in\n  the show, I&#x2019;m going to be lenient on it. I&#x2019;m not. You can do a lot with 12-13 episodes; <em>Anohana </em>had 12\n  episodes and it was executed very well due to a tight narrative focused on a few broken characters. In <em>Angel\n    Beats</em>, they could have done that, instead they focused on a plot that had no depth instead of focusing on the\n  characters, and they had so many characters you couldn&#x2019;t keep track of. Simply put, <em>Angel Beats</em> was trying to\n  do too much in too little time, and even with the budget constraints, they still could have done better. It was done\n  poorly; It was trying to create an amazing and interesting world full of interesting characters, interesting\n  back-stories, and a good concept, but by packing so much into so little time, it causes the show to be sub-par with a\n  boring tone.

He meets a girl named Yuri who\n  invites him to join the Afterlife Battlefront, an organization she leads which fights against the student council\n  president Angel a girl with supernatural powers to rebel against god. The rest of the story is Otonashi going with the\n  flow of the other, more interesting characters, and trying to find his back story. It&#x2019;s an interesting premise (if a\n  bit generic in structure if you take it face value), but it&#x2019;s just done horribly wrong. Did I mention that everybody\n  in purgatory lived an unfair life and usually died a pretty miserable death? This leads to tragic incidents that occur\n  just because of the nature of the setting... which I&#x2019;ll get to later. </p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">From the\n  description I gave, The main cast may seem interesting, but they are pretty boring in the long run. Our main Otonashi,\n  barely has a personality. He&#x2019;s supposed to be a viewer proxy, and the straight-man for the show, but instead what we\n  get is a boring main that lacks any appeal. He lacks the snark and interesting personalities that other Key mains\n  have, which just makes this more boring than it should be. Our main heroine, Angel, also known as Kanade, is a Kuudere\n  played straight. Very archetypal, very cold, and very boring. I have personal issues with the archetype itself, but\n  especially in a situation like this, it simply does not work. Key works rely on a romance, and when we have a romance\n  that has a heroine that shows no emotion, it&#x2019;s not enjoyable. Speaking of Romances, there&#x2019;s pretty much none here. The\n  show tries to do a love triangle with Yuri, who&#x2019;s a Haruhi clone without god powers, but they don&#x2019;t really go anywhere\n  with that and just ignore that love triangle to try to neatly wrap the show with a little bow (which fails, but I&#x2019;ll\n  get to that later).</p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 64.86486486486486%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1248126401720863814\" title=\"1248126401720863814\" src=\"/static/7c2f73145e638325f3af5ebd19a97dea/1c72d/1248126401720863814.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/7c2f73145e638325f3af5ebd19a97dea/a80bd/1248126401720863814.jpg 148w,\n/static/7c2f73145e638325f3af5ebd19a97dea/1c91a/1248126401720863814.jpg 295w,\n/static/7c2f73145e638325f3af5ebd19a97dea/1c72d/1248126401720863814.jpg 590w,\n/static/7c2f73145e638325f3af5ebd19a97dea/a8a14/1248126401720863814.jpg 885w,\n/static/7c2f73145e638325f3af5ebd19a97dea/fbd2c/1248126401720863814.jpg 1180w,\n/static/7c2f73145e638325f3af5ebd19a97dea/c58a3/1248126401720863814.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">The side characters were quite interesting, but the issue was they never got\nenough development and <strong>THERE WERE WAY TOO MANY</strong>. Many of them didn’t get any character development at\nall, and they were so shallow that you can describe them with personalities. You’ll probably do that, because some\ncharacters get very few screen time and it’s hard to juggle a cast so large. In general they were interesting (TK!),\nbut I never really cared about what happened to them due to the lack of character development.(also because you can’t\ndie in the purgatory world). They try to use the back-stories of characters as a replacement for actual interaction\nand development because they don’t have time to do so, which kinda work due to the fact that the flashbacks had a\ntighter narrative and were done better, but not completely because you don’t have development before hand. This is one\nof my gripes in a lot of shows; if the show just throw horrible situations at characters without getting to know them,\nit just leads to wasted potential, a general lack of interest in the viewer and a bitter taste in the viewers mouth.</p>\n</p>\n<p><video autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\"><source src=\"./1248126401809686598.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"/></video><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Also, this show tries to be a comedy and that aspect was done pretty well, with mostly\nentertaining jokes.

It&#x2019;s rubbish. Why did Otonashi get to purgatory if\n  he died without regrets? if he donated his heart to Kanade, why did Kanade come first to Purgatory? Kanade would have\n  had to live the rest of here life, die, then spend a year-ish in the Purgatory high to get to where she was in the\n  story... so what was Otonashi doing in that time? How did Otonashi not notice he didn&#x2019;t have a heart? Why didn&#x2019;t\n  Kanade just say thanks when she noticed it? The ending leaves so many questions, and it&#x2019;s just a rubbish ending that\n  breaks the suspension of disbelief. It tugs at your heart, yes... but it&#x2019;s a flawed way of doing it.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">The writing in <em>Angel Beats </em>is flawed, but mostly due to the execution. When you\n  execute a plot so horribly, it&#x2019;s a bad show, and it really drags the rest of the show down.</p>\n<h4 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h116427\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>Writing - 5/10</h4>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 12.162162162162163%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAIAAADXZGvcAAAACXBIWXMAAA9eAAAPXgEFzTgtAAAAfklEQVQI12PYbmS0x87uaEQEkNyqq7sDzF0vK7vT3Hybvv5iBoZlTEzLGBiWMDBs5OCNb7XP31cauy0lpdF+AzMnw6HAwDPZ2WeLii6Ul59KT79QUXGltfVoVNSx6GigiYsYGJYDNTMyAjVvEJPwnGxbsq8ielNCwGTHdXwCAAXjLq2nlErQAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1248126401915809862\" title=\"1248126401915809862\" src=\"/static/b1dc4d293dd25e3dcc49c781012f754c/fcda8/1248126401915809862.png\" srcset=\"/static/b1dc4d293dd25e3dcc49c781012f754c/12f09/1248126401915809862.png 148w,\n/static/b1dc4d293dd25e3dcc49c781012f754c/e4a3f/1248126401915809862.png 295w,\n/static/b1dc4d293dd25e3dcc49c781012f754c/fcda8/1248126401915809862.png 590w,\n/static/b1dc4d293dd25e3dcc49c781012f754c/9be90/1248126401915809862.png 636w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 62.83783783783784%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1248126401990819910\" title=\"1248126401990819910\" src=\"/static/13758da5beff489227c7fe5e9cb296e8/1c72d/1248126401990819910.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/13758da5beff489227c7fe5e9cb296e8/a80bd/1248126401990819910.jpg 148w,\n/static/13758da5beff489227c7fe5e9cb296e8/1c91a/1248126401990819910.jpg 295w,\n/static/13758da5beff489227c7fe5e9cb296e8/1c72d/1248126401990819910.jpg 590w,\n/static/13758da5beff489227c7fe5e9cb296e8/a8a14/1248126401990819910.jpg 885w,\n/static/13758da5beff489227c7fe5e9cb296e8/fbd2c/1248126401990819910.jpg 1180w,\n/static/13758da5beff489227c7fe5e9cb296e8/0f98f/1248126401990819910.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">I don’t think that the visuals in <em>Angel Beats</em> are something that will\nblow you away like other <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga='[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"http://tay.kotaku.com/rockmandash-reviews-nagi-no-asukara-anime-1567969970\",{\"metric25\":1}]]' href=\"http://tay.kotaku.com/rockmandash-reviews-nagi-no-asukara-anime-1567969970\">PA Works shows</a></span>,\nbut it’s pretty good. PA Works did a great job building an world with the visuals: interesting camera shots, great\nlighting, and art that makes the world feel like it has depth. Other than that, Angel Beats has solid action scenes\nneat effects and attention to detail that I appreciated; It has amazing gradients, accurate art and a solid aesthetic\ndesign overall. There’s one thing that bothered me about the art, and that was the characters. I think that some of\nthe characters in general look generic, and sometimes the animation and art of the characters can be rough around the\nedges at times. Overall though, it’s pretty good. </p></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <h4 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h116428\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>Visuals - 8/10</h4> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 12.162162162162163%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAIAAADXZGvcAAAACXBIWXMAAA9eAAAPXgEFzTgtAAAAfUlEQVQI12PYY2d30Nd3n5vbkdDQjSoqQPJ4XNzh4GAgWs7CsoyBAYQYGZYyMKxg43t/wvb/3/L//zOebbRdwsDGANR8ta3taFTU+dLSEwkJZ/Pz78yde66o6FRm5mp+/qUgnYxAtISBYb2U9I/HZv//nf3/f9Xnq7bLmbkAf2w2uiN58PAAAAAASUVORK5CYII=&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span> <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1248126402026301766\" title=\"1248126402026301766\" src=\"/static/17808a24fb55280c18d4deb905ce101c/fcda8/1248126402026301766.png\" srcset=\"/static/17808a24fb55280c18d4deb905ce101c/12f09/1248126402026301766.png 148w, /static/17808a24fb55280c18d4deb905ce101c/e4a3f/1248126402026301766.png 295w, /static/17808a24fb55280c18d4deb905ce101c/fcda8/1248126402026301766.png 590w, /static/17808a24fb55280c18d4deb905ce101c/9be90/1248126402026301766.png 636w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\"> </span> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gqxm--Wq82Y\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"Gqxm--Wq82Y\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://Gqxm--Wq82Y\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-Gqxm--Wq82Y\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">The day Key makes something with a bad soundtrack is the day pigs sprout wings and sail through the air, and to my knowledge, no pig has done so. If you like piano, you will be very happy... this soundtrack is full of amazing piano pieces and it&#x2019;s music to my ears. It has an amazing opening (one of my personal favorites), and the tracks themselves are always good. The Angel Beats soundtrack lives up to the name in quality, but when it comes to sound in anime, quality of tracks is not the most important part.... and frankly, this soundtrack is better standalone. </p> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM has-video media-large embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PL251F949563B531AC\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"PL251F949563B531AC\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://PL251F949563B531AC\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-PL251F949563B531AC\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Just as important as the quality of the soundtrack is the usage of it; In an anime, tracks need to make an atmosphere and the way the show implements the music into the show is quite poor. They reuse the same tracks for the times with tension which can have a negative impact on your enjoyment of the show and sometimes there are times where they should have some music but either there&#x2019;s no music, or it&#x2019;s really quiet so you don&#x2019;t notice it. This soundtrack fades too much into the background, which leads many of the tracks to not be memorable, even though they are pretty good. Also, Quantity; <em>Angel Beats </em>needs more music, playing at more times. With only 25 songs, and some sounding eerily similar to others, they blur and I&#x2019;d think this show would do better with more tracks. More of a good thing isn&#x2019;t bad.... Hopefully we&#x2019;ll get more in the VN?</p> <h4 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h116429\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>Sound - 7.5/10</h4> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 12.162162162162163%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAIAAADXZGvcAAAACXBIWXMAAA9fAAAPXwHXitrJAAAAhUlEQVQI1wF6AIX/AMttbdWHiNOBgsRXWM93eMhjZMlnZ8RWVs51ddubm8pnaNaKisxsbbgzNawTDvztQv791P//pO/LOqcFDgCpBgaoBwemBgasERGoCQmsERGmAwKmAwOkAQGoBwepBwenAwOoBQWmAQCmAw7sxEL/+S///zLemzyiAAUwKDWOnvV4dgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span> <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1248126402404622406\" title=\"1248126402404622406\" src=\"/static/dccdf8b6e01f7cb1dcf7444b51f54906/fcda8/1248126402404622406.png\" srcset=\"/static/dccdf8b6e01f7cb1dcf7444b51f54906/12f09/1248126402404622406.png 148w, /static/dccdf8b6e01f7cb1dcf7444b51f54906/e4a3f/1248126402404622406.png 295w, /static/dccdf8b6e01f7cb1dcf7444b51f54906/fcda8/1248126402404622406.png 590w, /static/dccdf8b6e01f7cb1dcf7444b51f54906/6af66/1248126402404622406.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\"> </span> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Overrated, underwhelming, wasted potential: the recipe for Hype backlash. No offence to any <em>Angel Beats </em>fans out there reading this, and sorry for a bit of pretentiousness in this segment here, but Angel Beats fans ruined the show for me, at least on my first watch. I came in with expectations; They said it was amazing, one of the best anime ever, and it will flood you with feels. To a guy who just finished <em>Clannad,</em> these are the words I wanted to hear. </p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Unfortunately, I did not notice the popularity of the show, and the demographics of the fans; <em>Angel Beats</em> is popular enough that the majority of the fans are what i&#x2019;d classify as a Lowest Common Denominator anime fan: The type who only watches the really well known shows, (mostly shounen). These people praise said shows like all hell in a fanboy-like fashion, they don&#x2019;t take an objective look on the series, and are generally a pain to deal with: they always compare the show they are talking about to the same few shows they have see, and they also go on fanboy attacks whenever you say anything about said show. </p> </div>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1248126402457684550\" title=\"1248126402457684550\" src=\"/static/fbeceddd914ac572081cbe4acee20e4e/1c72d/1248126402457684550.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/fbeceddd914ac572081cbe4acee20e4e/a80bd/1248126402457684550.jpg 148w,\n/static/fbeceddd914ac572081cbe4acee20e4e/1c91a/1248126402457684550.jpg 295w,\n/static/fbeceddd914ac572081cbe4acee20e4e/1c72d/1248126402457684550.jpg 590w,\n/static/fbeceddd914ac572081cbe4acee20e4e/a8a14/1248126402457684550.jpg 885w,\n/static/fbeceddd914ac572081cbe4acee20e4e/fbd2c/1248126402457684550.jpg 1180w,\n/static/fbeceddd914ac572081cbe4acee20e4e/ac99c/1248126402457684550.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">The first time I watched it, this show filled me with rage. I came in expecting\nsomething great, and what happened was that I was bored out of my mind with a boring world, meh writing, and a sub-par\ncast. every episode I was expecting something great, but got mediocrity instead. I was expecting tears, but what I got\nwas anger instead. I hated the show with a burning passion; How could something like this get popular? Why this\ninstead of something like <em>Kanon</em> or <em>Rewrite</em>? <strong>WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE THINKING?</strong> I did\nnot enjoy my first watch at all, and I came into this review ready to bash.</p></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Thankfully, I re-watch shows for reviews, and as you can see, the bashing did not\n  happen to the extent that I was expecting it to. Coming in with lower expectations totally changed the way I viewed\n  the show; I actually enjoyed this show a it, even with it&#x2019;s massive flaws in writing. I couldn&#x2019;t get the thought out\n  of my head on how much of Angel Beats is a waste of potential. It could have been a lot better; maybe not\n  <em>Clannad</em> levels of greatness, but at least <em>Rewrite</em> levels. Structurally, its sound; good production\n  values, good basic plot (if a bit boring), lots of potential when it comes to character development, and a potential\n  for feels.
