They’re fabulous.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Protonstorm:</strong> The folks at ufotable are amazing, their attention to detail\nis fantastic.</p></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>RockmanDash12:</strong> The production values in this show are seriously\n  insane. While some people may not think it’s the best looking because they aren’t a big fan of the aesthetic design\n  overall, you can’t deny that they did a great job with the production of it.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Grex:</strong>\n  The use of lighting and effects, even beyond the stellar animation itself, never failed to leave me stunned.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Protonstorm: </strong> I would say that the aesthetic design choices are\n  obviously a very subjective area of discussion, it can hardly be argued that the production using those design choices\n  is top-notch though.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>RockmanDash12: </strong>yeah, I really just adored the\n  way this show looked, from the scenery to the way that the magic looks in general.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Grex:</strong> Oh man, I had forgotten about the gorgeous backgrounds and\n  environments.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Protonstorm: </strong> Definitely, it’s also worth mentioning\n  that I personally enjoyed the direction ufotable took the aesthetic design, and thus also loved the way the magic was\n  animated.<br/></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>RockmanDash12:</strong> So, I take that as we’re all in agreement that this\n  show looks great, in the aesthetics, animation, etc. I just have to ask though, what were your guys thoughts on the\n  most striking aspects of visuals to most people, the fight scenes?</p>\n<video autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\"><source src=\"/850c9a75f5ea9b192ac8cf22a45fc333/1330439162258629669.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"/></video>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Grex: </strong>Of course, they were visually awesome, but I loved how fast\n  the fights could get, in comparison to <em>Fate/Zero</em>. It really hammered home how superhuman the Servants are,\n  for me.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Protonstorm: </strong> The fight scenes were glorious. I know that\n  there was a complaint floating around about perceived brevity in the scenes, but I greatly enjoyed what was there, the\n  details put into the magic and other abilities of the opponents made them quite the spectacle to watch.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>RockmanDash12: </strong>I personally think they could have been longer, but\n  that’s just me. Visually though, they’re pretty much everything I dreamed of after seeing the VN. So good.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>RockmanDash12: </strong>Anything else to add about the visuals?</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Protonstorm: </strong>Nothing much on my part. Calling them quite excellent about\n  sums it all up, in my mind.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Grex:</strong> Hah, same here. I don’t have much else to say on the\n  animation front. It’s ufotable. That really speaks for itself.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">\n<strong>RockmanDash12:</strong> I guess we should be moving on then.

I have listened through the entire album multiple times, and although some of the tracks sounded quite memorable, I couldn&#x2019;t place near any of them in the series.</p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Protonstorm: </strong> For what it&#x2019;s worth, I felt that the last couple of episodes executed the soundtrack significantly better than earlier portions of the show.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>RockmanDash12:</strong> huh. When we did the first cour review, I stated that it was the disappointment of the year for me. While it has improved, i&#x2019;m still pretty disappointed.</p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>RockmanDash12: </strong>The last few episodes really nailed it, and all the insert songs were just great, but I couldn&#x2019;t really care less about the soundtrack itself, even if i&#x2019;ve listened to it by myself.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>RockmanDash12:</strong> It&#x2019;s too subdued.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Protonstorm: </strong>I agreed with you at the time, but that was before the official release of the soundtrack, and hearing it on its own made me realize that there were a treasure trove of missed opportunities in its tracks that could have been used during the show to greater effect.</p> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ad2U5cfmql8\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"ad2U5cfmql8\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://ad2U5cfmql8\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-ad2U5cfmql8\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Grex: </strong>I agree with Proton. Listening to the soundtrack online, there were several tracks that I really liked on their own, but I couldn&#x2019;t remember them being used to any real effect in the show.</p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Grex:</strong> It wasn&#x2019;t a matter of soundtrack quality, it was a matter of use.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Protonstorm</strong>: Definitely.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"> <strong>RockmanDash12: </strong>The usage was a joke. There were long stretches of time without music where they really should have had music, and they never really used it to it&#x2019;s full potential.</p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>RockmanDash12:</strong> But I still think that the music, especially if you compare it to the rest of the Nasuverse is meh.</p> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GbqVWiWbeEo\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"GbqVWiWbeEo\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://GbqVWiWbeEo\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-GbqVWiWbeEo\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Protonstorm:</strong> I pretty much agree that the usage in general was terrible, although I do think that the final couple of episodes managed to pull of decent moments with the soundtrack. Soundtrack aside though, the opening theme for this cour as well as the insert song in episode 20, both sung by Aimer, were absolutely amazing both for their raw quality as well as their cinematic execution in the series.<br></p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Grex:</strong> Totally agreed.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>RockmanDash12: </strong>yup. </p> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/byPofX1IEZY\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"byPofX1IEZY\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://byPofX1IEZY\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-byPofX1IEZY\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Grex: </strong>I was so worried when I found out they wouldn&#x2019;t be using Lisa&#x2019;s version of This Illusion (from the first season&#x2019;s finale) for the new opening, but I ended up liking Brave Shine a lot.</p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>RockmanDash12:</strong> If they used This Illusion as the new opening, I would have been the happiest person out there.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>RockmanDash12: </strong>While I think This Illusion fits the overall work better, Brave Shine is a bit more fitting for the image of modern Type-Moon, and this adaptation so I don&#x2019;t really mind.</p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Protonstorm:</strong> As a matter of principle I don&#x2019;t mind the usage of Brave Shine as opposed to This Illusion, because this is ufotable&#x2019;s take on the series and while This Illusion would have been a wonderful choice as well, the fact that they went with a new and, in my opinion, excellent song as the opening theme instead is a choice that I would hardly begrudge them for.</p> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ow0n6CqDLk\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"4ow0n6CqDLk\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://4ow0n6CqDLk\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-4ow0n6CqDLk\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Grex:</strong> On the opposite end from the opening, I thought Kalafina dropped the ball on both credits themes.<br></p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Grex:</strong> They weren&#x2019;t bad per se, but they felt lacking.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Protonstorm: </strong>Absolutely, coudn&#x2019;t agree more. I felt like the second one in particular was lacking.</p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>RockmanDash12: </strong>Agreed here as well. They didn&#x2019;t stand out like Kalafina tracks typically do and I didn&#x2019;t really feel compelled to listen to them. I&#x2019;m one of the biggest Kalafina fans, but I really did not care for them at all.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Protonstorm: </strong>I think it was a matter, in part, of the tonal dissonance in the second track to the actual mood of the show it was supposed to be the ending theme for. It felt more like a church choir performance than an ending to a battle for the world. There was also significantly less interesting usage of the vocalists at Kalafina&#x2019;s disposal than previous tracks.

It was really difficult to maintain\n  my suspension of disbelief, particularly for those two instances you named.

These in F/SN do not fall under those exceptions.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Grex:</strong> Completely agreed. It’s a lazy tactic that does nothing but\n  break your immersion in the story.

That said, I believe\n  that F/SN and F/Z were written in completely different directions, so generally speaking it feels to me more like\n  personal preference is the primary factor in whether or not most people like one over the other, as opposed to either\n  series actually being greater.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Grex:</strong> That&#x2019;s a question I&#x2019;ve asked myself, and I&#x2019;m really not sure\n  which series I prefer.

Like I&#x2019;ve said many times in the past,\n  I&#x2019;m a type moon nut. I&#x2019;m not super receptive of the anime as a whole, as I think the VN did a much better job with the\n  story, handling the themes better due to the PoV, but the Anime does a decent enough job of adapting the work (much\n  better than the 2010 movie) and if you&#x2019;re an anime fan, it&#x2019;s better than nothing at all. I just feel like it loses a\n  lot of the reasons why I loved the story in the first place, and it definitely has issues, which really bum me\n  out.<br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">In comparison to the VN, no contest, but in comparison to F/Z, it&#x2019;s pretty\n  tricky. Anime wise, F/Z all the way because it was so much better thematically in its execution and the music just\n  kicks F/SN&#x2019;s ass. <em>Fate/Zero </em>was better handled, feeling like a more complete work, and that&#x2019;s coming from a\n  person who didn&#x2019;t like <em>Fate/Zero</em> nearly as much as If you asked me my thoughts of F/SN vs F/Z overall though,\n  I actually prefer the more personal, not as epic scale approach because it allows the viewer to get a better scope of\n  the ideals, the core of the story.</p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMFBAb/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAv/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABl2Od3zKBAv8A/8QAGxAAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgMAARETMjP/2gAIAQEAAQUCS21Fsoo0stg+Rdf/xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEf/aAAgBAwEBPwFH/8QAFBEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEP/aAAgBAgEBPwE//8QAGRAAAwADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECECFh/9oACAEBAAY/AlSIpPRT7hDP/8QAGxABAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFRgaH/2gAIAQEAAT8hzUVs5IieRVvcpLSnEXUVQ90//9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABA/L//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABMf/aAAgBAwEBPxDEh//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEf/aAAgBAgEBPxCsf//EABsQAQEAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACEQMUFR/9oACAEBAAE/ELAjS8p5jwZSQk2t39w0MCVrt3iEj4YgRgjxH//Z&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1330439165701568805\" title=\"1330439165701568805\" src=\"/static/be39fd454397b26ad0c8e4ae21480ad1/1c72d/1330439165701568805.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/be39fd454397b26ad0c8e4ae21480ad1/a80bd/1330439165701568805.jpg 148w,\n/static/be39fd454397b26ad0c8e4ae21480ad1/1c91a/1330439165701568805.jpg 295w,\n/static/be39fd454397b26ad0c8e4ae21480ad1/1c72d/1330439165701568805.jpg 590w,\n/static/be39fd454397b26ad0c8e4ae21480ad1/a8a14/1330439165701568805.jpg 885w,\n/static/be39fd454397b26ad0c8e4ae21480ad1/fbd2c/1330439165701568805.jpg 1180w,\n/static/be39fd454397b26ad0c8e4ae21480ad1/eea4a/1330439165701568805.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>RockmanDash12:</strong> And for those bitching about the tone, <em>Heaven’s\nFeel</em>.
