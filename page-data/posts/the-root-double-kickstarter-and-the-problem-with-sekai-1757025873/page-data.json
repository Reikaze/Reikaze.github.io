To anyone who knows the people involved with this, one could not help but get excited. The game was helmed by the director of<em> Ever 17 - The Out of Infinity</em>, a much loved visual novel that is rather influential in the western visual novel community, and is also the spiritual predecessor of the <em>Zero Escape</em> series - visual novels that are proclaimed to be some of the best games of all time. The translation group, Lemnisca, is one that&#x2019;s dedicated to translating science-fiction visual novels and its members have worked on works in the <em>Infinity</em> series, as well as the popular visual novel <em>Steins;Gate</em>. Everyone involved with the project brings excitement, except for the most important part of the puzzle: Sekai Project.</p> </div>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUDBP/EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBA//aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB6crJ5Q1kp//EABsQAAMAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMTERIh/9oACAEBAAEFApx+OaNbODqjXDP/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEwH/2gAIAQMBAT8BniT/xAAXEQEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARIT/9oACAECAQE/Aby0f//EABoQAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAQIQITH/2gAIAQEABj8CYkbtWMcHNYP/xAAbEAADAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARFBYSExUf/aAAgBAQABPyFypLsdvLkl2HjY0eDWG5TbzD//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAECvP/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQAB/9oACAEDAQE/ENIyF//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEAAf/aAAgBAgEBPxDGZX//xAAcEAEAAgIDAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMUFRkaH/2gAIAQEAAT8QG2NhOPIUqRggd/CAjnGySmEJAWDfZZG2f//Z&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"zmbigpod07edx5zavakc\" title=\"zmbigpod07edx5zavakc\" src=\"/static/ff3835cc3c09472d1c7e10c162925097/1c72d/zmbigpod07edx5zavakc.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/ff3835cc3c09472d1c7e10c162925097/a80bd/zmbigpod07edx5zavakc.jpg 148w,\n/static/ff3835cc3c09472d1c7e10c162925097/1c91a/zmbigpod07edx5zavakc.jpg 295w,\n/static/ff3835cc3c09472d1c7e10c162925097/1c72d/zmbigpod07edx5zavakc.jpg 590w,\n/static/ff3835cc3c09472d1c7e10c162925097/4b190/zmbigpod07edx5zavakc.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Sekai Project is a really important part of the visual novel community, but its\nimportance does not come without a cost.

As time has past, it has been shown that even though they started it\nall and consistently bring over great visual novels, the way they do it, primarily though their kickstarters, has not\nbeen smooth at all.

They have a fair amount of poorly advertised\nand managed kickstarters that either barely make it or fail, like <em>Narcissu</em> or their magical boy kickstarter\nrespectively. They run into what seems to be a never ending amount of controversy or issues during the kickstarter\neven when the kickstarters are doing fine financially, like the Grisaia dakimakura and boxart issues.

This kickstarter has had a fair bit of problems, nearly all of them because of Sekai Project&#x2019;s handling of the kickstarter:<br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>1. </strong>They put up a Prefundia page during December, then for the whole month before the kickstarter came up, they proceeded to ignore nearly every suggestion and criticism for the kickstarter that was passed onto them. While this may seem minor, nearly every future issue about the kickstarter itself was mentioned here. They essentially let all of the problems with the kickstarter just stream into the actual KS itself when they could have dealt with them beforehand, like Degica did with the <em>Muv-Luv Alternative </em>controversy they had.</p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>2. </strong>They released <em>Root Double&#x2019;</em>s kickstarter right next to another visual novel kickstarter, <em>Libra</em>, which, because <em>Libra </em>has done so much better than <em>Root Double,</em> has led to a whole set of controversy and nearly everyone questioning Sekai Project&#x2019;s competence early on. (Side tangent here, this probably didn&#x2019;t affect the <em>Root Double </em>kickstarter that much as they have completely different demographics, just FYI for those concerned about this.)</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>3.</strong> They failed to advertise or fix anyone&#x2019;s issues until they realized that there was no way that this would make its goal unless it got a last-minute push, which they did by flooding the kickstarter with new tiers, new pricing, new rewards, a vita port, etc.</p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>4.</strong> They put the kickstarter way too close to launch. It&#x2019;s so close that many people (including myself) felt that it pretty much feels like a worthless endeavor because the game is coming out anyways. FYI, the game was already translated before the kickstarter rolled out - the kickstarter began in early January and the game is due for launch in March. Of this year.</p> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y7RB6nLPOc0\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"Y7RB6nLPOc0\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://Y7RB6nLPOc0\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-Y7RB6nLPOc0\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>5.</strong> Early on, the kickstarter looked like a statistical improbability unless they did a drastic change in the middle of it. Why do I say this? Let&#x2019;s take a look at the numbers:</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">For a Visual Novel, The <em>Root Double</em> kickstarter is asking for a fair bit of money, $135,000 USD, to be exact. This number is even more daunting when you compare it to other Sekai Project kickstarters, which are probably the best ways to predict how this was going to go. They are asking essentially the same amount that they did for the rather popular <em>Clannad</em> which was $140,000, and is within striking distance of <em>Grisaia</em>&#x2019;s $160,000 USD, a visual novel claimed to be one of the best out there and has a significant fanbase. The thing is though, there&#x2019;s no way <em>Root Double</em> would have ever pulled the same amount of weight because those games have existing and rather large fanbases. They are the face of the genre, so of course they are going to do well! A small Sci-Fi VN isn&#x2019;t going to be able to compete.</p> </div>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 62.83783783783784%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"xj9x64pizjn4tfjyevig\" title=\"xj9x64pizjn4tfjyevig\" src=\"/static/f099449dbf425cd9545ac354f440f9bc/fcda8/xj9x64pizjn4tfjyevig.png\" srcset=\"/static/f099449dbf425cd9545ac354f440f9bc/12f09/xj9x64pizjn4tfjyevig.png 148w,\n/static/f099449dbf425cd9545ac354f440f9bc/e4a3f/xj9x64pizjn4tfjyevig.png 295w,\n/static/f099449dbf425cd9545ac354f440f9bc/fcda8/xj9x64pizjn4tfjyevig.png 590w,\n/static/f099449dbf425cd9545ac354f440f9bc/c5bb3/xj9x64pizjn4tfjyevig.png 680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">So, how could they hit this number? When you look at the track record of Sekai\nProject’s kickstarters of works that do not have large, pre-existing fan bases, their kickstarters usually get around\n~1,500 people, give or take a few hundred people. Given that number, this means that they expected an average of 90\ndollars per person, but there was no way they’d hit that average without good upper tiers and early on their upper\ntiers were abysmal - it was one of the most common complaints of the kickstarter. Even though the kickstarter was\nupdated many times, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga='[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"http://prefundia.com/projects/view/root-double-before-crime-after-days-xtend-edition-heading-west/7236/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]' href=\"http://prefundia.com/projects/view/root-double-before-crime-after-days-xtend-edition-heading-west/7236/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">you can see the Prefundia</a></span> <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga='[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"http://prefundia.com/projects/view/root-double-before-crime-after-days-xtend-edition-heading-west/7236/\",{\"metric25\":1}]]' href=\"http://prefundia.com/projects/view/root-double-before-crime-after-days-xtend-edition-heading-west/7236/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">page</a></span> to look at what the kickstarter was like earlier on in the\ncampaign and you can see how the tiers were a bad value. So even if people were interested in the product, the tiers\ndidn’t justify contributing so much. The worst part was when Sekai Project essentially punched fans in the gut midway\nthrough - Many people were asking for a Vita version because many people interested in <em>Root Double</em> aren’t the\npeople who traditionally hang around in the VN community and have Windows tablets. They’re the people in the Vita\ncommunity who like JRPGs or story-based games (plus, people in the Vita community are looking for every possibility to\nplay on it, so that is in the best interests of Sekai Project). When they announced the Vita tier, they limited it to\n225 dollars or up.<strong> WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT???</strong></p></p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 31.08108108108108%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"hkyclrwrraykxefjij6b\" title=\"hkyclrwrraykxefjij6b\" src=\"/static/9d665781bbf0864955eceb2499e73ece/fcda8/hkyclrwrraykxefjij6b.png\" srcset=\"/static/9d665781bbf0864955eceb2499e73ece/12f09/hkyclrwrraykxefjij6b.png 148w,\n/static/9d665781bbf0864955eceb2499e73ece/e4a3f/hkyclrwrraykxefjij6b.png 295w,\n/static/9d665781bbf0864955eceb2499e73ece/fcda8/hkyclrwrraykxefjij6b.png 590w,\n/static/9d665781bbf0864955eceb2499e73ece/c5bb3/hkyclrwrraykxefjij6b.png 680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">With the updates at the end, spending more made much more sense, but that brings\nus to another issue: Why were they frantically updating it at the end in the first place? Why not just put the effort\nin preparing it at the beginning of the kickstarter and save all of this stress? I honestly don’t know, but if I had\nto make an educated guess, I’d say it’s Sekai Project not caring enough, acting like a failing student until they\nrealize they aren’t going to pass the class so they rush to do as well as possible. There’s also another possibility,\nbut this one isn’t nearly as pretty: the potential reason that they do these kickstarters.<br/></p></p>\n<hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\">\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"d3a5xqpyvtbpr3hghwz4\" title=\"d3a5xqpyvtbpr3hghwz4\" src=\"/static/d2c353a1b4585169251cd37afe9b7010/1c72d/d3a5xqpyvtbpr3hghwz4.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/d2c353a1b4585169251cd37afe9b7010/a80bd/d3a5xqpyvtbpr3hghwz4.jpg 148w,\n/static/d2c353a1b4585169251cd37afe9b7010/1c91a/d3a5xqpyvtbpr3hghwz4.jpg 295w,\n/static/d2c353a1b4585169251cd37afe9b7010/1c72d/d3a5xqpyvtbpr3hghwz4.jpg 590w,\n/static/d2c353a1b4585169251cd37afe9b7010/a8a14/d3a5xqpyvtbpr3hghwz4.jpg 885w,\n/static/d2c353a1b4585169251cd37afe9b7010/fbd2c/d3a5xqpyvtbpr3hghwz4.jpg 1180w,\n/static/d2c353a1b4585169251cd37afe9b7010/eea4a/d3a5xqpyvtbpr3hghwz4.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>*Disclaimer*</strong> - The next part of the article is just speculation\n  from the author. This is may or may not be the case, and we will never know unless they explicitly say it, but this is\n  what I believe.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Let&#x2019;s head back to the 4th problem of the kickstarter for a moment -\n  the fact that the kickstarter was released really close to launch. Why would they do this? If the game was already\n  finished translating, why couldn&#x2019;t you just release the game? I believe it&#x2019;s due to the very nature of the visual\n  novel community that they made popular. Sekai Project announces a lot of projects, and when you think about how niche\n  this is genre is, one must wonder how they stay afloat, and how they manage to afford to keep publishing these visual\n  novels. If an expensive visual novel fails, they would be in a world of trouble. I believe they ran this kickstarter\n  not because they needed the money, but because they have little confidence that this game would recuperate the costs\n  of publishing itself. When you look at the works kickstarted and the ones just published regularly, the ones that are\n  published regularly are visual novels that are low risk. They are either small visual novels that were so cheap that\n  budget wasn&#x2019;t really an issue, or visual novels that have a large enough fanbase were probably cheap to licence and\n  would easily recuperate their costs, with games like <em>Planetarian</em> and <em>G-Senjou no Maou</em> as examples.\n  Given this, I believe that Sekai Project kickstarted <em>Root Double</em> because they want to balance their budget\n  before they release the work, to guarantee that the game is profitable. Also, I&#x2019;m not the only one who believes this -\n  another blogger, the one who wrote the article on <em>World End Economica </em>I linked earlier, mentioned that &#x201C;One\n  of their staffers said they want to make sure to cover all their bases, thus avoid as much risk as possible.&#x201D;, which\n  is understandable, but isn&#x2019;t that great of a deal for us. </p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 45.27027027027027%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"icklvbii66mqkyjfnktc\" title=\"icklvbii66mqkyjfnktc\" src=\"/static/f4ca92f0d559bcc43cd6ee463dfb0310/1c72d/icklvbii66mqkyjfnktc.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/f4ca92f0d559bcc43cd6ee463dfb0310/a80bd/icklvbii66mqkyjfnktc.jpg 148w,\n/static/f4ca92f0d559bcc43cd6ee463dfb0310/1c91a/icklvbii66mqkyjfnktc.jpg 295w,\n/static/f4ca92f0d559bcc43cd6ee463dfb0310/1c72d/icklvbii66mqkyjfnktc.jpg 590w,\n/static/f4ca92f0d559bcc43cd6ee463dfb0310/f84cf/icklvbii66mqkyjfnktc.jpg 880w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"> You may not think that this is a big deal, as they run a business, but this\nmeans that along with being incompetent at management, they are anti-consumer, their business model isn’t sustainable,\nas this means that they aren’t able to take hits in sales if something goes wrong. Also, this means they have major\nstructural issues with the company that prevents them from running in a proper manner, and they are abusing\nKickstarter, treating it as a glorified pre-ordering system. This is absolutely horrible to me as the sales should\ndetermine how a game should do, not a KS, and the fact they did a kickstarter in general isn’t the greatest of news\nfor this one. They asked too much, they failed to advertise this well, the rewards are a joke, and it’s coming out\nanyways. There’s a laundry list of issues with Sekai Project and the Kickstarter make it hard to justify supporting\nthings people love. I personally still backed the kickstarter, given that some of the people involved worked on some\nof my favorite works, but even through my fanboy glasses I can see the cracks and issues of a company that’s led the\ncharge of visual novels through this kickstarter. From the surface, they seem perfectly fine, but the more you look\nin, the more deficiencies you see. </p></p>\n<hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"/><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><em>You’re reading Rockmandash Reviews, a blog focused on\n  everything revolving Visual Novels.
