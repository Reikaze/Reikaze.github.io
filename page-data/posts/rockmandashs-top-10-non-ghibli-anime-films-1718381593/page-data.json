Almost all of the\n  popular Anime are TV series, and even when you start thinking about Anime Films, most people go straight to Ghibli,\n  for a reason... they make excellent films, and there aren&#x2019;t a lot of alternatives out there. That being said, these\n  cult classics and obscure titles that are Non-Ghibli Anime Film, while few in number, are some of the best experiences\n  in the medium, and are works many just pass over... so after seeing<span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga=\"[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://thebests.kotaku.com/studio-ghiblis-movies-ranked-1718105786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]\" href=\"http://thebests.kotaku.com/studio-ghiblis-movies-ranked-1718105786\"> Kotaku&#x2019;s Bests of Studio Ghibli Movies</a></span>,\n  and the beginnings of the AniTAY Movie Night, I decided I&#x2019;d make a list of the best Anime Movies I&#x2019;ve seen that aren&#x2019;t\n  Ghibli.</p>\n<div class=\"bxm4mm-2 hKBnez js_video-sticky__top-limit\"></div>\n<div class=\"bxm4mm-4 fQqUFt\"></div></div>\n<div class=\"bxm4mm-1 gKeXmA js_video-sticky-trigger\"></div>\n<div class=\"bxm4mm-0 jRTmst instream-native-video instream-permalink js_video-sticky-target instream-native-video--mobile\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bxm4mm-3 eCMXYG js_video-sticky__bottom-limit\"></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">So, What are the rules of\n  this list, you may ask? I have one main rule for this list: There will be one film per Identity/Group (Director,\n  Company, etc), which means that this isn’t necessarily a top 10 movies in the traditional sense, but more a collection\n  of movie groups associated with one identity, with the film on the list acting as a representative of that group and\n  my personal preference. This is because the list is made with the intent of recommending works to others, to spread\n  the word of their existence and how good they are, so I want a rather diverse list. This rule is to diversify the list\n  so it’s not all just one series while maximizing the recommendations I can give to people as I can mention the other\n  works during their spot. While you may think this is unfair to some films, this is to make the list a better list, and\n  is the way I’m operating this. I apologize in advance.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Also, I’d like to keep in mind\n  that all of the movies here are ones I think are pretty great. Even though it may be lower on the list, that doesn’t\n  mean that it’s a bad work, it’s still a stellar movie and I’d recommend all of these.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h4 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h108011\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a><strong>HM#1: <em>Cowboy Bebop: Knockin&#x2019; on Heaven&#x2019;s Door</em></strong><br></h4> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aa4z_ey1MS4\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"aa4z_ey1MS4\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://aa4z_ey1MS4\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-aa4z_ey1MS4\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Description: </strong>As the Cowboy Bebop crew travels the stars, they learn of the largest bounty yet, a huge 300 million Woolongs. Apparently, someone is wielding a hugely powerful chemical weapon, and of course the authorities are at a loss to stop it. The war to take down the most dangerous criminal yet forces the crew to face a true madman, with bare hope to succeed. <em> - Plot Description from MAL</em></p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>For the purpose of a diverse list, I wanted the ones on the main list to be movies mostly unrelated to a series, ones that can be watched standalone, so I only have a few series movies on the list, but there are some rather well known and great series movies that have to be somewhere on this list, so I&#x2019;ll mention them here.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">About <em>Cowboy Bebop: Knockin&#x2019; on Heaven&#x2019;s door</em>... It&#x2019;s <em><strong>COWBOY BEBOP</strong></em>! While it&#x2019;s just a side story taking place between episodes 22 and 23, it&#x2019;s more of one of Cowboy Bebop, a show that&#x2019;s one of the best that anime has to offer with a style you don&#x2019;t see in modern day shows. Combine one of the best and most memorable dubs in anime history, with great writing, incredibly fluid animation, fantastic by Shinichiro Watanabe and an amazing score Yokko Kano makes this one of the best this media has to offer while expanding on what made the original so great. It&#x2019;s amazing.</p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>If interested, you should also check out... </strong>the respective work. Duh! You kinda need experience with Bebop to watch this, so go watch it now! It&#x2019;s great!</p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h4 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h108012\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>HM#2.

Unlike<em> Bebop</em> however, this was made much later, so<em> Trigun: Badlands Rumble</em> has the advantage of production values, with madhouse at the top of their game, making one of the best looking anime I&#x2019;ve ever seen.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>If interested, you should also check out </strong>Trigun. Same with Bebop, it&#x2019;s great and you should probably go see it.

Stripped of his alchemical powers, he has been all this time researching rocketry together with Alphonse Heiderich, a young man who resembles his own brother, hoping to one day find a way back home. His efforts so far had proven fruitless, but after lending a hand to a troubled gypsy girl, Edward is thrown in a series of events that can wreak havoc in both worlds. Meanwhile, at his own world, Alphonse Elric ventures deeper into the mysteries of alchemy in search for a way to reunite with his older brother. - <em> Plot Description from MAL</em></p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>This is a personal favorite of mine, so you could swap <em>FMA:B The Sacred Star of Milos </em>here, but I can&#x2019;t really. I love Alternate history, adore it. Next to dystopias, it&#x2019;s one of my favorite literature genres, so imagine how I felt when I saw <em>FMA: Conquerer of Shamballa</em>, a movies of a series that was up there as one of my favorite anime of all time? I loved it, and to this day it&#x2019;s my favorite part of the series. Regardless of your thoughts of the main series, this movie takes a questionable ending and runs with it, throwing in the hectic Nazi Germany and managing to handle it extremely well in what I would consider to be one of the best anime movie endings of all time, something that manages to bridge the gap between fantasy and our own world in one of the best ways possible, while being an absolutely kickass story by itself. It&#x2019;s great.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>If interested, you should also check out </strong>some of the works later on this list, and of course, FMA. I&#x2019;d recommend checking out both <em>FMA </em>&amp;<em> FMA:B</em>, going <em>FMA</em> to this, then <em>FMA:B</em> then <em>Sacred Star of Melos</em>. It&#x2019;s a rather great series, so you should have a blast with this one.</p> </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h108014\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a><strong>10.<em> The Place Promised in Our Early Days</em></strong></h2> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OCO-csVHouo\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"OCO-csVHouo\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://OCO-csVHouo\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-OCO-csVHouo\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Description: </strong>In an alternate timeline, Japan was divided after losing World War II: Hokkaido was annexed by &#x201C;Union&#x201D; while Honshu and other southern islands were under US sovereignty. A gigantic yet mysterious tower was constructed at Hokkaido and could be seen clearly from Aomori (the northernmost prefecture of Honshu) across Tsugaru Strait. In the summer of 1996, three 9th-graders had made a promise that one day they&#x2019;ll build an aircraft and unravel the tower&#x2019;s mystery, but their project was abandoned after the girl, Sayuri Sawatari, began experiencing sleeping sickness and transferred to Tokyo for better treatment. Three years later, Hiroki Fujisawa accidentally found out that Sayuri had been in a coma since then, and he asked Takuya Shirakawa to help him finding a way to revive her. What they don&#x2019;t know yet is that Sayuri&#x2019;s unconsciousness is somehow linked with secrets of the tower and the world. - <em> Plot Description from MAL</em></p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>To start up this list, A Shinkai film! No, it&#x2019;s not <em>5CM Per Second</em>, and I&#x2019;m sure that&#x2019;s the one most people would put on this list given the rules I set in place and it&#x2019;s popularity, but this is my favorite of his by far. Makoto Shinkai films are impressive: called the next Miyazaki by some, Shinkai creates some of the most beautiful, visually stunning works you can see out there, with some of the best scenery, music (Tenmon is amazing) and atmosphere in the whole medium, while working with a small amount of people, essentially an indie (He animated his first movie all by himself!). Also, his works are known to be very emotional, handling his themes of separation extremely well, and creating a world and scenario that is rather realistic, but once you&#x2019;ve seen one, you&#x2019;ve essentially seen them all. Why <em>The Place Promised</em> then? It&#x2019;s really the best he&#x2019;s done to me, as it combines a longer length which I believe his film really needs with an Alternate history plot (which is something I rather adore) and Shinkai&#x2019;s mainstays to create the most meaningful, most engaging, and most powerful film I think he&#x2019;s ever made.</p> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span> <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1447855651659673384\" title=\"1447855651659673384\" src=\"/static/943196a2c2d8eca7cd7638de4fc1dce6/1c72d/1447855651659673384.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/943196a2c2d8eca7cd7638de4fc1dce6/a80bd/1447855651659673384.jpg 148w, /static/943196a2c2d8eca7cd7638de4fc1dce6/1c91a/1447855651659673384.jpg 295w, /static/943196a2c2d8eca7cd7638de4fc1dce6/1c72d/1447855651659673384.jpg 590w, /static/943196a2c2d8eca7cd7638de4fc1dce6/a8a14/1447855651659673384.jpg 885w, /static/943196a2c2d8eca7cd7638de4fc1dce6/fbd2c/1447855651659673384.jpg 1180w, /static/943196a2c2d8eca7cd7638de4fc1dce6/0f98f/1447855651659673384.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\"> </span> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">If that&#x2019;s the case, you may ask me, why is it at the bottom of my list? That&#x2019;s more personal preference than anything: I&#x2019;m relatively vocal about my distaste twords Shinkai films, and every time I see them, I find that I&#x2019;m never able to connect with them because of the general execution of the characters, and the way that the films are handled. To me, All of Shinkai&#x2019;s films feel a tad bit distant, and considering these are films focused on romance or themes about the essence of people, this is a rather large flaw. A large part of this is because I believe you as a viewer simply do not spend enough time with the characters to know them or relate to them unless you&#x2019;re extremely similar to them. My choice for this list, <em>The Place Promised in Our Early Days</em>, being full feature length manages to do it&#x2019;s intended goal better than <em>5CM Per Second. </em>That being said, I have to say these works definitely grow on you, and if you do relate to the characters, these can be some of the most powerful films you may see. Almost everything else is done so well that I feel like it deserves a place on this list. (And if I didn&#x2019;t have it, I&#x2019;d probably be mobbed by <em>5CM Per Second </em>fans....)<em> </em><br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>If interested, you should also check out </strong>the rather popular<strong> </strong><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga=\"[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://tay.kinja.com/dexs-review-5-centimeters-per-second-1499521371&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]\" href=\"http://tay.kinja.com/dexs-review-5-centimeters-per-second-1499521371\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>5 Centimeters</em></a></span><em> </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga=\"[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://anitay.kinja.com/5-centimeters-per-second-manga-review-1699292964&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]\" href=\"http://anitay.kinja.com/5-centimeters-per-second-manga-review-1699292964\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Per Second</em></a></span>, which according to fans is one of the most moving films out there.

One day when she is exploring in a forbidden zone, she is startled by a strange bat-like creature and tumbles headlong into a void - and out into the wide open world above the surface, a place with reversed physics, where if she let go she would &#x201C;fall up&#x201D; into the sky and be lost forever. Age is a student on this surface world, a totalitarian society whose compliant population has been brainwashed against the &#x201C;sinners who fell into the sky.&#x201D; When he spies Patema hanging upside-down from a tree, he pulls her down to safety, struggling with all his might to keep her earthbound as she grips on to him for dear life. Together their weights cancel each other out, and once they master the art of navigating competing gravitational forces, they set out to evade the leaders of Age&#x2019;s world and discover the secret that keeps their worlds apart. - <em> Plot Description from MAL</em></p> </div>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 60.810810810810814%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1447855651743221288\" title=\"1447855651743221288\" src=\"/static/edcbfb7625606bc5b0788ac49c20d693/1c72d/1447855651743221288.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/edcbfb7625606bc5b0788ac49c20d693/a80bd/1447855651743221288.jpg 148w,\n/static/edcbfb7625606bc5b0788ac49c20d693/1c91a/1447855651743221288.jpg 295w,\n/static/edcbfb7625606bc5b0788ac49c20d693/1c72d/1447855651743221288.jpg 590w,\n/static/edcbfb7625606bc5b0788ac49c20d693/a8a14/1447855651743221288.jpg 885w,\n/static/edcbfb7625606bc5b0788ac49c20d693/fbd2c/1447855651743221288.jpg 1180w,\n/static/edcbfb7625606bc5b0788ac49c20d693/b17f8/1447855651743221288.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Justification &#x26; Thoughts: </strong>From another writer and director\nwho’s primarily done anime films that’s highly acclaimed, we have Yasuhiro Yoshiura’s <em>Patema Inverted</em>, a very\ninteresting, original and well executed sci-fi dystopian story with a premise that just grabs your attention. The\nthemes and concept that this show handles because of this premise and the dystopia it creates is rather great, and\nwith the totalitarian society and opposing realities, this movie is thought provoking and engaging throughout, an\nexperience you don’t see in many anime out there. It’s done pretty well in almost every element you can think of, with\ngreat characters, interesting banter and interactions that make the work that much better, an interesting handle of\nperspectives with good writing and direction overall, a great ending that’s rather fufilling unlike so many other\nseries, and on and on and on. This movie is engaging and entertaining in ways that many aren’t while being something\nmore, being extremely well rounded, and production values that are definitely worthy of a feature film. <br/></p></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Why 9th on the list then? Mainly because while this movie is done really well, so\n  are the rest of the movies on this list, and<em> Patema Inverted</em> doesn’t have something extraordinary like the\n  rest of this list, it’s just a really well done movie. It’s more about the rest of this list, and not so much this\n  work itself. </p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>If interested, you should also check out </strong>Yasuhiro\n  Yoshiura’s other works, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga='[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"http://anitay.kinja.com/grexs-time-of-eve-review-1720540823\",{\"metric25\":1}]]' href=\"http://anitay.kinja.com/grexs-time-of-eve-review-1720540823\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Time of Eve</em></a></span><em>, </em>a rather\n  interesting and thought provoking work about how robots interact with humans in a future society, and <em>Pale\n    Cacoon, </em>an ONA about a post apocalyptic colony with archives to the past. <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga='[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"http://anitay.kinja.com/patema-inverted-ani-tay-review-and-discussion-1678652596\",{\"metric25\":1}]]' href=\"http://anitay.kinja.com/patema-inverted-ani-tay-review-and-discussion-1678652596\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Also, check out our review! :D</a></span></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h108016\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a><strong>8. <em>Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade</em></strong></h2> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tmmoBsMw5w0\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"tmmoBsMw5w0\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://tmmoBsMw5w0\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-tmmoBsMw5w0\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Description: </strong>After witnessing the suicide bombing of a terrorist girl, Constable Kazuki Fuse becomes haunted by her image, and is forced to undergo retraining for his position in the Capital Police&#x2019;s Special Unit.

Yes, this is my Mamoru Oshii work for this list as it was written by him, but when people would think about his works, most people would focus on the extremely well regarded and influential<em> Ghost in the Shell, </em>a Sci-Fi movie that provides a world and ideas that have inspired a generation. While nowhere near as groundbreaking or influential as <em>GITS</em>, <em>Jin-Roh</em> is is great for all the same reasons, but why <em>Jin-Roh</em> over <em>GITS</em>? Because I love alternate history (it has a Germany occupied Japan!), I believe <em>Jin-Roh</em> has a cleaner, more focused and stronger narrative that engages you more instead of spending most of it&#x2019;s times philosophically waxing (It has it&#x2019;s moments, but for the most part is more narrative focused), and themes that are more relatable to our world than in <em>GITS</em> that I just preferred. It&#x2019;s just personal preference here, nothing more, nothing less.</p> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 54.05405405405405%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span> <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1447855652106470952\" title=\"1447855652106470952\" src=\"/static/343c0efbb98c864d1a95abb9f8514d33/1c72d/1447855652106470952.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/343c0efbb98c864d1a95abb9f8514d33/a80bd/1447855652106470952.jpg 148w, /static/343c0efbb98c864d1a95abb9f8514d33/1c91a/1447855652106470952.jpg 295w, /static/343c0efbb98c864d1a95abb9f8514d33/1c72d/1447855652106470952.jpg 590w, /static/343c0efbb98c864d1a95abb9f8514d33/a8a14/1447855652106470952.jpg 885w, /static/343c0efbb98c864d1a95abb9f8514d33/fbd2c/1447855652106470952.jpg 1180w, /static/343c0efbb98c864d1a95abb9f8514d33/72a7d/1447855652106470952.jpg 1306w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\"> </span> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Mamoru Oshii works are great because they provide a great world with an engaging and fascinating ideas that help think about our own, with <em>Jin-Roh </em>focusing on the past with it&#x2019;s alternate history, and <em>GITS </em>the future, handled in a mature way.

There are other reasons why I prefer 2.22 like having an actual budget to make it look beautiful in HD, but\n  really, the subversion was great and the movie is executed extremely well.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>If\n  interested, you should also check out </strong>The original <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>, which you kinda really\n  need to watch that before watching rebuild, as your enjoyment is significantly influenced by the original and rebuild\n  is written in a way that is best experienced with prior knowledge of the series. Also check out the rest of the\n  rebuild series, but <em>3.33 <strike>You Can (Not) Have</strike> You Can (Not) Redo </em>may not be your cup of tea. I\n  liked it!

Now that we&#x2019;re at the latter half of this list, we are are the best of the media, the films that one could describe as a masterpiece. This film is <em>Wolf Children</em>, a creation from the extremely talented<strong> </strong>Mamoru Hosoda, who&#x2019;s known for making really high quality works. While they may be a bit ghibli-esque and simplistic for some, they are extremely well executed with a straight and powerful narrative, great production values, the works. They are great films that anyone can enjoy, but are great regardless of that fact. All of his films could slot in this list, but Wolf Children just edges out.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><em>Wolf Children</em> manages a coming of age story in a beautiful way, executed in a way that truly deserves the praise it gets by it&#x2019;s large a. It may not be the most child friendly due to the content, but it&#x2019;s a story that is extremely touching, rather moving and extremely engaging, with wonderful characters and relationships that just steal the show. It&#x2019;s a truly <strike>wolf </strike>human work, and it&#x2019;s absolutely phenomenal.</p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>If interested, you should also check out </strong>Hosoda&#x2019;s other films,<em> The Girl Who Leapt Through Time</em> which is rather self explanatory<em>, Summer Wars </em>which involves an awesome net world with hacking<em>, &amp; The Boy and the Beast, </em>his newest movie.</p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h108020\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a><strong>4. <em>The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya</em></strong></h2> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qpbySfGofVc\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"qpbySfGofVc\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://qpbySfGofVc\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-qpbySfGofVc\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Description: </strong>It is mid-December, and SOS Brigade chief Haruhi Suzumiya announces that the Brigade is going to hold a Christmas party in their clubroom, with Japanese hotpot for dinner.

Well, that&#x2019;s exactly what we have here, a movie manages to keep what the original does great while blowing everyone&#x2019;s expectations away with a twist on the lackadaisical premise of the series that makes for a phenomenal movie, with an incredibly well executed atmosphere and amazing character development in a series that has almost none. It&#x2019;s a prime example of using a media to execute a story in a powerful way though, like so much of this list and it hooked me and engaged me throughout the time I went through the story.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>If interested, you should also check out </strong>Other KyoAni works and Movies, as they are rather surprising like this, providing for a much deeper experience than the original show offers, while keeping the charm that made you invested into the series in the first place.

The genius director Satoshi Kon has inspired and influenced so many creative minds and viewers with the masterpieces he has made, groundbreaking films that blend fiction and reality in a way that rarely has been matched. These are really great films that some could debate to be the best films out there, regardless of animated or not, works that truly deserve being called a masterpiece, pushing cinema and animation to the next level.... and if my words aren&#x2019;t enough, Every Frame A Painting has a great overview on his style and editing, and while it doesn&#x2019;t capture everything about him, it gives you a good idea on why people love his films so much. </p> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oz49vQwSoTE\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"oz49vQwSoTE\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://oz49vQwSoTE\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-oz49vQwSoTE\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">I haven&#x2019;t seen all of Kon&#x2019;s works so far so I&#x2019;m not the best to judge, but I absolutely fell in love with <em>Perfect Blue</em> and that&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s on this list, a psychological thriller out of what seems to be a regular idol story, warping into a reality that is more bizarre than fiction in the form of an amazing ride that was an amazing experience. It&#x2019;s done exceedingly well, and it&#x2019;s one that should be on your short watch list.

Credited as an essential part of getting anime outside of the west, starting what many would consider to be the golden age in the 90s, shaping modern anime as we know it and influencing many works to come with it&#x2019;s amazing setting of Neo Tokyo and trippy/strong plot that involves lots of screaming <strong>TETSUOOOOO </strong>and<strong> KANEDAAAAAA. </strong><em>Akira</em> is bigger than anything I could ever aim to cover with a few paragraphs so I won&#x2019;t even try, but what you do need to know is that it&#x2019;s a great experience and don&#x2019;t be discouraged from watching it because people say it&#x2019;s confusing or hard to understand, those aren&#x2019;t elements that shouldn&#x2019;t keep you from watching the greatness that is <em>Akira</em>. </p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>If interested, you should also check out... </strong>well, a lot of stuff on this list, and a lot more. It started the &#x201C;golden age&#x201D; of anime, so stuff like <em>GITS</em>, <em>Serial Expiraments Lain</em>, etc will be right up your alley if you liked this one. I also recommend reading the manga as that&#x2019;s the anime of <em>Akira</em> but even better, with the anime serving as an introduction of sorts and barely scratching the surface of what <em>Akira </em>truly is. If you&#x2019;re interested in more by the creator of<em> Akira</em> but finish the manga, check out <em>Steamboy</em>.<br></p> </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h108023\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>1. <em>Kara no Kyoukai: Paradox Spiral</em></h2> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4q_eNz3wMs\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"J4q_eNz3wMs\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://J4q_eNz3wMs\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-J4q_eNz3wMs\"></span></span></div> <blockquote class=\"sc-8hxd3p-0 nvIqO\" data-type=\"BlockQuote\"><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">*Note* - Video Trailer is not of <em>Paradox Spiral</em> in particular, but a trailer of the whole series in general.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Description: </strong>Set in Japan predominantly during the late 1990s, the series chronicles the life of Ry&#x14D;gi clan heiress, Shiki Ry&#x14D;gi, and her relationship with classmate Mikiya Kokut&#x14D;.

The series deals with the paranormal and tackles mature themes such as suicide, rape, patricide, incest and murder.Its lore and story draws inspiration from various religious philosophies and psychological concepts such as multiple personalities; the anima and animus; the nature of sin; life, death and reincarnation; and the paradoxical nature of the Taiji.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Paradox Spiral - November 1998: Shiki meets a boy named Tomoe Enjou, a runaway who claims to be a murderer.
