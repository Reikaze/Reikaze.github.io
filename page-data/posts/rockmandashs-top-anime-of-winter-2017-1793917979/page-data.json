I don&#x2019;t see the point in only giving a show one chance during it&#x2019;s airing season, and this is my list so\n  I&#x2019;ll list my favorite shows regardless of what season it started on. If this means that one show hogs the top spot for\n  2 seasons, than good for that show! If it&#x2019;s an OVA or movie that came out during the duration of the season I fell in\n  love with, then it may be there. Also, I think that the seasonal split is arbitrary and unnecessary, so it&#x2019;s\n  completely gone here. Sorry about that, but that&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;m doing it.<br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Just an FYI,\n  the placement of the show in the list is mostly based on my experience and enjoyment of the work, so if you&#x2019;re\n  wondering why something isn&#x2019;t where you think it should be or you can&#x2019;t really tell via the justification, that&#x2019;s\n  probably why. Keep in mind, just because a show is lower on the list doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s bad - all of these are great,\n  and a lower placement isn&#x2019;t a mark against the show, at this point it&#x2019;s nearly all personal preference.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h4 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h97351\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a><em>Honorable Mention: Rewrite Season 2</em>&#xA0;<br></h4> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HxEYk62rQDE\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"HxEYk62rQDE\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://HxEYk62rQDE\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-HxEYk62rQDE\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Anime Made By:</strong> 8bit</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"> <strong>Genre: </strong>Action, Comedy, Supernatural, Romance, School</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Summary: </strong>The story of Rewrite follows our protagonist Kotarou, who lives an average life in the environmental conscious Kazamatsuri, a city that is a forerunner in ecological studies. He lives a normal life for the most part, until Kotarou decides to make the occult research society go into the forest looking for unidentified mysterious animals. Instead of UMAs however, Kotarou finds himself in the middle of a conspiratorial conflict and with a weird power.

It was clusterfuck of epic proportions, with 8bit showing once again that they have no idea how to manage a visual novel: it mashed together all the routes into one horrifying thing that would occupy your TV, it was simultaneously too fast and too slow, it spent a massive amount of time on boring slice of life that didn&#x2019;t serve any purpose, etc.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Season 2 however, is a passable show, and is one that actual humans can enjoy! This can be mostly contributed to the different structures of the routes covered: in season one, they tried to adapt the common route, as well as simultaneously adapt 5 separate routes, but in season 2, we have 2 linear stories: Moon and Terra. They managed a faithful adaptation that was entertaining, moving, etc. It was surprisingly good, and I enjoyed it every Sunday it came out.</p> </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h97352\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a><em>6.

They were all very entertaining shows that were executed well, doing what all good slice of life shows should do: they all continuously showed us different aspects of the characters we see, were all consistently entertaining, had amusing character interactions, were filled with funny jokes, and more.

It&#x2019;s a refreshing show, one that revels in desires and character interactions unlike anything an anime (or TV in general) has covered, but while it&#x2019;s so vastly different, it feels so relatable, because it is simply the execution of a human story. While the desires of the characters can be considered as the title suggests, the desire of something one can never get, and having to live our live without being able to even dream of it is something that is ultimately relatable, and that is the magic of this show. we see human problems with human relationships and human characters, wrapped in a package that is compelling, engaging and more. While this show may not be for everyone, for those who it is for, they will absolutely love it.</p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h97355\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>3. <em>Saga of Tanya the Evil</em><br></h3> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CMwlVyfy3m4\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"CMwlVyfy3m4\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://CMwlVyfy3m4\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-CMwlVyfy3m4\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Anime Made By: </strong>NUT<br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"> <strong>Genre: </strong>Military, Magic</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Summary: </strong>In an alternate version of the year 1924, war rages on, but the most deadly soldier around is neither a grizzled old veteran, nor a wise and patient general. Rather, it is a very young girl by the name of Tanya Gurtcheff, whose mind for tactics and affinity for magic are both second to none. While most of Tanya&#x2019;s military colleagues either applaud her endless victories, or fear her merciless attitude, not a soul is aware of her true nature. Despite appearances, Tanya is no mere little girl, but a ruthlessly efficient Japanese salaryman, reincarnated into this parallel world after angering a being which called itself &#x201C;God&#x201D;, as a wager to see if hardship and turmoil would kindle religious devotion. Eager to prove &#x201C;God&#x201D; wrong, Tanya is prepared to use every trick in her arsenal and claw her way to the top of this new reality, in order to once again live a comfy and peaceful existence</p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Like the character Tanya, the show <em>Saga of Tanya the Evil </em>beats all the odds in a world made for it to fail, defying everything one would expect from it. A show with a loli as a main character in a boring and grey war show, made with a brand new studio... nothing good could have come out of it, but it managed to be amazing. After<em> Izetta </em>bombed last season with an almost identical premise, we expected that out of Tanya... but instead we got what <em>Izetta </em>should have been, a fascinating alternate history twist on world war 1 with our main character not being your typical little girl, but a deeply logical Japanese businessman turned into a little girl and facing a relentless battle against god, aka being X! Seeing this conflict was extremely entertaining, adding onto the enjoyment that comes from Tanya as a character, and the amazingly animated fights. All and all, a stellar show.</p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h97356\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>2. <strong><em>Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu Season 2</em></strong></h3> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vGx7u3hMCOA\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"vGx7u3hMCOA\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://vGx7u3hMCOA\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-vGx7u3hMCOA\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Anime Made By: </strong>Studio Deen<br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Genre: </strong>Drama, Historical</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Summary: </strong>Following the conclusion of rakugo practitioner Yakumo Yurakutei VIII&#x2019;s dramatic story of his past growing up under the names Bon and Kikuhiko and his tumultuous friendship with fellow rakugo trainee Sukeroku Yurakutei II and relationship with the geisha Miyokichi, the story shifts to Yakumo&#x2019;s student Yotaro as he takes on the title of Sukeroku Yurakutei III. Despite becoming well beloved in the rakugo community, Yotaro still struggles with escaping the spectre of his checkered past and finding his own style of rakugo, all while trying to juggle his personal life and helping the field of rakugo evolve with the times, instead of dying out. - <em>Plot Summary from the</em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga=\"[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://anitay.kinja.com/the-8-anime-of-winter-2017-you-should-be-watching-1792572408&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]\" href=\"http://anitay.kinja.com/the-8-anime-of-winter-2017-you-should-be-watching-1792572408\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em> 8 Anime of Winter 2017 You Should Be Watching Article</em></a></span></p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>It would not be an understatement to say that Rakugo is one of the best shows I&#x2019;ve ever seen. Season 1 was phenomenal; a beautiful and extremely well executed historical drama that absolutely took me and the AniTAY community by surprise. While the plot of Rakugo may sound boring because it&#x2019;s literally about telling stories, it is the execution, how it tells the story that makes this great, being able to handle all of its elements extremely well. The show has fantastic pacing, solid visuals, a great score, amazing characters and the best part: it&#x2019;s consistently engaging with every episode being better than the last. </p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Season 2 is more of everything great about Rakugo Season 1... but while the quality of Rakugo never falters, being a phenomenal show until the end, Season 2 made a fundamental change that takes away from what made me love the show so much, so personally I didn&#x2019;t enjoy season 2 as much. Season 1 of Rakugo was a historical set piece, a flashback to a time when master Yakumo was growing up and his story, in one of my favorite settings. Going from a historical coming of age to a more modern story following a yotaro/former criminal as he does rakugo... it wasn&#x2019;t exactly what I was hoping for. Definitely worth a watch, and the ending is phenomenal, but it isn&#x2019;t as golden as Rakugo Season 1.</p> </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h97357\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>1. <strong><em>KonoSuba: God&#x2019;s Blessing on This Wonderful World!

Following his sudden death and rebirth into a new fantasy world, Kazuma thought that his new life would be that of an amazing video game hero. However, this fantasy world quickly proved that not to be the case. Kazuma is paired up with useless allies, has mediocre stats, and every time he does something good it seems to just cause more problems for him. After living in this world for a while, he thought that he might grow used to things, but this too is clearly not the case. To make matters worse, after narrowly defending the town from a roving Ancient Weapon/Natural Disaster, Kazuma inadvertently teleported the exploding core of the machine to an aristocrat&#x2019;s mansion. Now he is suspected of treason.

Season one of Konosuba was already a riot, a show that both played with the tropes of a fantasy &amp; isekai story as well as dealing with an amazing cast, season 2 amps it up. The cast is funnier, the scenarios are more entertaining, the antics are better, etc. While the animation quality might have dipped, they use the animation more effectively, to make the gags better, to make the show more entertaining, and it really worked. Every moment, every episode had my laughing, and I was always looking forward to the newest episode of this show. I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve laughed as hard as I did with Konosuba this season, and I&#x2019;m not sure if I will ever again.</p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><em>Thank you for reading!
