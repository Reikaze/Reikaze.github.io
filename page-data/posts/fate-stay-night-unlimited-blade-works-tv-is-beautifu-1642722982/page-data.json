The art is so refined\nthat one can’t help but admire the amount of detail and work that they put into it, and the show definitely earns the\nmoniker <em>Unlimited Budget Works </em>that everyone has been calling it. To me, it has one of the best aesthetic\ndesigns in anime, the amount of visual effects like bokeh that this show has is simply outstanding, the way they use\nthings like lighting and different angles to enhance the mood is great, the characters expressions are more vivid and\nfull of life than almost all anime, and the way they rendered everything… just beautiful.

To put it frankly, it’s everything I ever\n  dreamed of from <em>Fate/stay night</em> when it comes to the fight scenes, and they are everything I could have ever\n  imagined or even better. When Studio Deen did their adaptations, the fight scenes were frankly, absolutely nothing\n  special, and in the Visual Novel, the fights weren’t that visually impressive: they were still images with effects.\n  Fast and furious, the fights are visually impressive, extremely engaging, do a great job at representing the movement\n  and feel of the fight. Also, it’s an anime that really cares about cinematography, and the cinematography is just one\n  of the best that anime has to offer, along with shows like <em>GARO</em>, <em>Bahamut</em>, etc. It’s a sight to\n  behold, and it’s very impressive. My only real issue with them is that I wish they were longer or slower for the sake\n  of the story, but you can’t really count that as an issue when it’s just wishing for more good stuff, right?</p>\n<video autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\"><source src=\"/59835a2acccea6cd01dc0f9a2fcfc721/1316014531671470914.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"/></video>\n<hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\">\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 12.162162162162163%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAIAAADXZGvcAAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAAATUlEQVQI112LSwrAIBQDvf99XLrzAnoGlwrSUoT3bVwVCwMJYRLczFUP3GXOVauMwb2jY/k7wCzsYP4ggkmtXTHeKT05r1L2WeTQgOoLv5pztNxEUwYAAAAASUVORK5CYII=&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1316014531725596994\" title=\"1316014531725596994\" src=\"/static/34f955e41ea1b06cf22517a1c41959a3/fcda8/1316014531725596994.png\" srcset=\"/static/34f955e41ea1b06cf22517a1c41959a3/12f09/1316014531725596994.png 148w,\n/static/34f955e41ea1b06cf22517a1c41959a3/e4a3f/1316014531725596994.png 295w,\n/static/34f955e41ea1b06cf22517a1c41959a3/fcda8/1316014531725596994.png 590w,\n/static/34f955e41ea1b06cf22517a1c41959a3/9be90/1316014531725596994.png 636w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 55.4054054054054%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQCAwX/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAf/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABsXmgW0Z5T//EABwQAAICAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAAMSFCEjMv/aAAgBAQABBQK6zrZshsFQnMt95Gf/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABACH/2gAIAQMBAT8BJxv/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAECAQE/AT//xAAbEAACAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIhEjFRgf/aAAgBAQAGPwL0k3PF8ErL4SNn/8QAGxABAAMBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARMSFBUXH/2gAIAQEAAT8hoHxOcRhNgHKo91DeuqSROmNE8OCf/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABCHH//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAEf/aAAgBAwEBPxALaQv/xAAXEQEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEh/9oACAECAQE/EA7YX//EABwQAQEAAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERADEhQVFxgf/aAAgBAQABPxCgIosThjmmXLRMJD3gR/bY+TCfhErpJHHOpTRbCawIhaA8d5//2Q==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1316014531761667650\" title=\"1316014531761667650\" src=\"/static/9607b21a7ed995e6fe8dc0d5dcad842a/1c72d/1316014531761667650.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/9607b21a7ed995e6fe8dc0d5dcad842a/a80bd/1316014531761667650.jpg 148w,\n/static/9607b21a7ed995e6fe8dc0d5dcad842a/1c91a/1316014531761667650.jpg 295w,\n/static/9607b21a7ed995e6fe8dc0d5dcad842a/1c72d/1316014531761667650.jpg 590w,\n/static/9607b21a7ed995e6fe8dc0d5dcad842a/a8a14/1316014531761667650.jpg 885w,\n/static/9607b21a7ed995e6fe8dc0d5dcad842a/fbd2c/1316014531761667650.jpg 1180w,\n/static/9607b21a7ed995e6fe8dc0d5dcad842a/e5166/1316014531761667650.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">What’s not nearly as impressive however, is the way the how the story in general\nwas executed, with major flaws in the writing, the pacing, and the way that they presented this plot negatively\naffecting the experience.

The <em>Unlimited Blade Works </em>Anime/VN route in particular just uses the\n  Holy Grail War as a backdrop to tell Shirou&#x2019;s story, struggling with himself about himself and his ideal, having to\n  confront them head on. </p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1316014531795000130\" title=\"1316014531795000130\" src=\"/static/9966a659b55e4f9d10de089ee6d63087/1c72d/1316014531795000130.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/9966a659b55e4f9d10de089ee6d63087/a80bd/1316014531795000130.jpg 148w,\n/static/9966a659b55e4f9d10de089ee6d63087/1c91a/1316014531795000130.jpg 295w,\n/static/9966a659b55e4f9d10de089ee6d63087/1c72d/1316014531795000130.jpg 590w,\n/static/9966a659b55e4f9d10de089ee6d63087/a8a14/1316014531795000130.jpg 885w,\n/static/9966a659b55e4f9d10de089ee6d63087/fbd2c/1316014531795000130.jpg 1180w,\n/static/9966a659b55e4f9d10de089ee6d63087/fb0df/1316014531795000130.jpg 1993w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">The removal of monologuing completely changes this: while Anime fans may mock VN\n  fans for caring so much about this little change and say it&#x2019;s necessary to adapt the work, I&#x2019;d say that this change is\n  detrimental to the story, ruining it and everything it stands for. Due to the first person, monologue filled\n  perspective, The VN made you feel like you were with Shirou, going through the challenges of The Holy Grail War,\n  experiencing everything with him, connected. It made you care about the character, feeling his idealistic beliefs,\n  engaging you whenever he head to deal with them in the route. This is the core of <em>Fate/stay night, </em>and\n  nowhere is this more prevalent than in my favorite route, <em>Unlimited Blade Works,</em> where they specifically\n  focused on Shirou and his ideals. </p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"> Without this element that only the crazy VN\n  fanbois complain about, <em>Unlimited Blade Works</em> loses the essence of what makes it what it is, becoming a dull,\n  lifeless show without it&#x2019;s own flare. The Visual Novel let you get to know the scenes, get you to feel the ideas and\n  thoughts of the characters, the anime just shows you the events that occur. This show makes you feel like an observer,\n  and because of that, the amount of engagement the viewer has in comparison to the reader of the VN is completely\n  different. With this one change, the story moves the focus away from Shirou and his ideals to solely the events,\n  preventing you from engaging with the story and falling in love with it as much as you could in the past. This one\n  change is the difference between a work that makes people fall in love with a series, and one that makes people feel\n  lukewarm about the work, the change that changes your entire experience. The story relies on your caring of Shirou and\n  the characters to do what it does, making the scenes important and meaningful but without that, the scenes are just\n  scenes, lacking in substance and lacking in emotion. It takes engagement to evoke empathy after all, and this change\n  prevents them from evoking that empathy when they need it. This story really uses it&#x2019;s thematic, emotional elements,\n  like with betrayal and the Shirou/Archer fight, but if you don&#x2019;t care about them, then what can you do? </p>\n<p><video autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\"><source src=\"./1316014531851397698.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"/></video><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">There’s also the issue of the structure: The story is ment to be played in a specific\norder, all at once and the piecemeal style adaptation screws with this. There’s a lot of character development is done\nin the Fate route, and the Fate route gets your mind in the perspective that you need to be in when playing UBW<em>\n(Order: Fate -> UBW -> HF)</em>. The Fate route is about Shirou’s ideal, a relatively simple shounen story\nthat gets you to care about Shirou and Saber It develops two of the main characters to the point that you actually\ncare about them, helps the story along. That being said, it eerily resembles what archer went through, getting you to\ncare about archer once he gives his major exposition. There are issues that many (ie,<em> </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga='[[\"Embedded Url\",\"External link\",\"http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-fate-zero-ani-tay-1538163593\",{\"metric25\":1}]]' href=\"http://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-fate-zero-ani-tay-1538163593\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fate/Zero</em></a></span> fans) may have with the story that are covered in HF, and\nthe story is just a better experience as a whole. </p></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Also, due to the nature of Visual Novels, there are a few major things that are impacted in a huge way that have made this show a much less enjoyable experience, things that even non-VN fans complain about: a presentation that lead to poor pacing and horrible stopping points. Visual Novels are not serialized works and there is no stopping point, as the reader stops where they want. A VN is based on natural stopping points, and when adapting a VN, they need to make stopping points. These are pretty rough with UBW, and made watching it brutal, expecially in the first half, exacerbating the issues one may have with the series.</p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 12.162162162162163%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAIAAADXZGvcAAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAAASElEQVQI122KQQrAIBAD/f9/RPyAL/GssKWgYbOrHi0NcwjDBP8batXWDLAx9qHIsWafLDjpwAX5lvLkvJGUJEbt/bRzXpnqAs2sc0vADkM/AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span> <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1316014531914936642\" title=\"1316014531914936642\" src=\"/static/e1c5a012119b3a263f9e335a247542de/fcda8/1316014531914936642.png\" srcset=\"/static/e1c5a012119b3a263f9e335a247542de/12f09/1316014531914936642.png 148w, /static/e1c5a012119b3a263f9e335a247542de/e4a3f/1316014531914936642.png 295w, /static/e1c5a012119b3a263f9e335a247542de/fcda8/1316014531914936642.png 590w, /static/e1c5a012119b3a263f9e335a247542de/9be90/1316014531914936642.png 636w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\"> </span> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2h0bm2Fn72g\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"2h0bm2Fn72g\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://2h0bm2Fn72g\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-2h0bm2Fn72g\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Music is essential part of any Audio-visual medium like Anime, as it effects nearly everything in the work: it effects the mood of the show which effects how you the viewer, it creates an atmosphere of the show which helps develop the characters and the world, and it makes things memorable. Now, imagine having seen a story with music, then without and you kinda get a grasp of how I feel seeing Ufotable&#x2019;s <em>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works.</em>.. The soundtrack is almost nonexistent and what&#x2019;s there is extremely subdued due to the execution of it. While some may chop this up to me being a VN fan, this isn&#x2019;t a Yuki Kajura soundtrack, and it&#x2019;s execution is bad by pretty much any standards. The soundtrack doesn&#x2019;t engage the viewer when it needs to, it doesn&#x2019;t support the story much at all and doesn&#x2019;t even play half of the time. Yes, there are moments where it really shines with it&#x2019;s execution like the fight scenes, but fight scenes aren&#x2019;t everything.</p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Frankly, the execution is a big part of why the show at times can feel more dull than it really should be. The slow pace is exasperated, making the wonky pacing of the show even more apparent, the memorable scenes are made completely irrelevant because of the score and the viewer is left relatively unengaged, to the detriment of the entire work. Other works manage to make a slow pace engaging so it rarely becomes an issue, but<em> Unlimited Blade Works </em>fails to do this, with a depressing execution that could have been so much more. There is no atmosphere to get you into the work, there is nothing that keeps you attached to the story from the music, and this is just bad execution.</p> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOSpsBkE5nY\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"HOSpsBkE5nY\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://HOSpsBkE5nY\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-HOSpsBkE5nY\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">The sad part is that the issue doesn&#x2019;t lie with the songs, or the talent of the people behind it, it lies solely on the stylistic choice they made with the execution, something that just makes me depressed everytime I watch this show.

I don&#x2019;t really think that it works in this situation, and it definitely doesn&#x2019;t work in the way that they executed it, not supporting anything on the screen a majority of the time. </p> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m39V4AjsBYQ\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"m39V4AjsBYQ\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://m39V4AjsBYQ\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-m39V4AjsBYQ\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">That being said, it does have it&#x2019;s strong points. The soundtrack itself is really solid... yes, I would prefer it to be not so subdued, but it sounds rather impressive with it&#x2019;s use of instruments shown in standouts like the Archer track, and Rin&#x2019;s Melody. Listening to the soundtrack outside of the show is quite nice, but it just makes you think of the missed potential, how everything went wrong when actually making the show. The insert songs that this show has, <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga=\"[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB0nlGG-iVg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB0nlGG-iVg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This Illusion</a></span> and <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga=\"[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://anitay.kinja.com/op-ed-a-day-last-stardust-fate-stay-night-unlimited-1706597248&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]\" href=\"http://anitay.kinja.com/op-ed-a-day-last-stardust-fate-stay-night-unlimited-1706597248\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Last Stardust</a></span> were just amazing and used absolutely brilliantly, making scenes extremely memorable and moving the viewer to no end. The moments that these insert songs created were brilliant, but this is something that many shows can execute throughout the show without the need for fancy lyrical songs, and this show should have been able to do that too. Also, last but not least, the Voice actors are the same as they always use for the fate characters and they did a great job once again, no problems there. <br></p> </div>\n<hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\">\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 12.162162162162163%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAIAAADXZGvcAAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAAAZElEQVQI1y2LQQrAIBAD/f9/PHiQ0pP4Bs+FilSkWqjuululQkhCmAgm4t6nEJm5Ovc6hzFCCHCe7TjAe7yusVCtA5jYzxOJGQBLzI+1edtuKbNSjzFF61GGl33HlOa5tQX3/gEc9nA6hI9uJwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1316014531964559426\" title=\"1316014531964559426\" src=\"/static/2b0de2c558e4a4478e112ede7a92356e/fcda8/1316014531964559426.png\" srcset=\"/static/2b0de2c558e4a4478e112ede7a92356e/12f09/1316014531964559426.png 148w,\n/static/2b0de2c558e4a4478e112ede7a92356e/e4a3f/1316014531964559426.png 295w,\n/static/2b0de2c558e4a4478e112ede7a92356e/fcda8/1316014531964559426.png 590w,\n/static/2b0de2c558e4a4478e112ede7a92356e/9be90/1316014531964559426.png 636w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1316014532001913410\" title=\"1316014532001913410\" src=\"/static/0d5aead5acf3c2793e07893d159eeb9c/1c72d/1316014532001913410.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/0d5aead5acf3c2793e07893d159eeb9c/a80bd/1316014532001913410.jpg 148w,\n/static/0d5aead5acf3c2793e07893d159eeb9c/1c91a/1316014532001913410.jpg 295w,\n/static/0d5aead5acf3c2793e07893d159eeb9c/1c72d/1316014532001913410.jpg 590w,\n/static/0d5aead5acf3c2793e07893d159eeb9c/a8a14/1316014532001913410.jpg 885w,\n/static/0d5aead5acf3c2793e07893d159eeb9c/fbd2c/1316014532001913410.jpg 1180w,\n/static/0d5aead5acf3c2793e07893d159eeb9c/eea4a/1316014532001913410.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">I don’t think I’ve been as exited for an anime as much as I have been for <em>Unlimited\nBlade Works</em>.

And to give Deen credit, even though 2012 was pretty sketch in\nanimation and actually telling the story, they replicated the feel of the route much better than 2014, and I’d\npersonally go back to 2012 before 2014 because of it. This is not to say you’ve done something wrong by starting off\nfrom a place that wasn’t the VN, but looking objectively, UBW simply isn’t as good as the source, even though it looks\nso much better. To those who haven’t seen the source and are enjoying it, that’s because UBW is doing a decent job at\nadapting the story, and supplementing it storywise but even those should be able to see the issues with UBW (TV),\nmainly the pathetic soundtrack that fails to enhance the mood of the scenes. It’s the experience that matters, and\nit’s the experience that makes all the difference. If a show captures the message, feel and experience of a work, it’s\na great adaptation, and if not, it’s not great, and UBW (TV) isn’t a great adaptation.</p></p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1316014532089761602\" title=\"1316014532089761602\" src=\"/static/a0c21a5e781a515d998517af07923b6e/1c72d/1316014532089761602.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/a0c21a5e781a515d998517af07923b6e/a80bd/1316014532089761602.jpg 148w,\n/static/a0c21a5e781a515d998517af07923b6e/1c91a/1316014532089761602.jpg 295w,\n/static/a0c21a5e781a515d998517af07923b6e/1c72d/1316014532089761602.jpg 590w,\n/static/a0c21a5e781a515d998517af07923b6e/16274/1316014532089761602.jpg 852w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">That being said, pretty much all of my complaints were swept away episode 20 onwards, where\nthey finally nailed pretty much everything with great music, great pacing, great action, etc. I was crying in joy when\nwatching episode 20, it was just so good.....
