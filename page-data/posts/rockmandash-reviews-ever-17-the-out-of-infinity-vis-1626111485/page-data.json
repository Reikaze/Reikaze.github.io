Has that experience rose to the top of your favorites\n  because you liked it so much, but is obscure to the point that almost nobody you know has even heard of it? Whether\n  you’ve have had this experience or not, today we’re going to review a game that influenced me in the very same way as\n  that hypothetical.

They have no communication with the outside\n  world, no way to escape, and due to the difference in pressure, they only have 119 hours to live. As they try to find\n  out a way to get out of the complex, they come across many aspects of this incident that feel off. As the clock ticks,\n  the events begin to intensify, and the group begin to unravel the mysteries about the situation around them, and about\n  themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"> How could you not be interested in that? The premise itself is unique\n  and interesting, and the way <em>Ever 17 </em>handles it is something I really appreciate, focusing on character\n  interactions, and mystery. A good majority of the story is character interactions, and this may be a plus or minus\n  depending on who you are. <em>Ever 17</em> is primarily Slice of Life, and this may inhibit your enjoyment of the\n  game. The tedium of going through these conversations may get on your nerves, and because it&#x2019;s long and has slow\n  pacing, this may be very frustrating if you do not enjoy this type of story. It&#x2019;s common route may tire you, just like\n  how Kid is tired of chicken sandwiches. I personally enjoyed it, but there were times where I got bored of it and\n  started skipping on my first playthrough.</p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1306104797872267178\" title=\"1306104797872267178\" src=\"/static/af0ff2fb3881757516dd0037b48deff9/1c72d/1306104797872267178.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/af0ff2fb3881757516dd0037b48deff9/a80bd/1306104797872267178.jpg 148w,\n/static/af0ff2fb3881757516dd0037b48deff9/1c91a/1306104797872267178.jpg 295w,\n/static/af0ff2fb3881757516dd0037b48deff9/1c72d/1306104797872267178.jpg 590w,\n/static/af0ff2fb3881757516dd0037b48deff9/a8a14/1306104797872267178.jpg 885w,\n/static/af0ff2fb3881757516dd0037b48deff9/4f94f/1306104797872267178.jpg 982w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">On the flipside, this time is used to develop the characters, and when they are developed\nin used in their routes, it can lead to great things. This is one thing that Ever 17 has over it’s spiritual\nsuccessors: it has characters that are actually memorable. In <em>Ever 17</em>, there are 5 routes, 4 focused on one\nheroine (Two under Takeshi’s perspective, and the other Two under Kid’s perspective), with the last one (Coco’s route)\nserving as a true route that combines everything you’ve experienced into one amazing story. The character arcs are\ngreat because they both develop the heroine and the main character, and the interactions between said characters are\ninteresting due to interesting aspects in the characters, and solid chemistry. It even has some enjoyable romance!\n(it’s not the main focus, but it’s still enjoyable.) While the characters basic personalities may be kinda\narchetypical, they all develop into something a bit more than a typical archetypical character, and they all have\ninteresting and unique about them which ties into the story. They are all memorable to me, and they are all great\ncharacters that I love to see.</p></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">If character interactions are the meat of the plot, the mystery would be what pushes\n  the story forward. The intrigue they build with the differences in the routes, the concepts they cover that don&#x2019;t\n  really get explanation, the weird things that shouldn&#x2019;t happen, the other characters, they all urge you on. You never\n  know what&#x2019;s going to happen in the story, but at the end everything is pieced together in the last route, and it&#x2019;s\n  brilliant. You will want to binge through this game.

Just to list some of them, we\n  have 4th dimensional beings, a 3rd eye, syphons, AI that&#x2019;s nearly human, extremely lethal viruses, cloning, etc. Of\n  course, this is all fiction, but the fact that it feels realistic adds to the story. It&#x2019;s interesting, well explained,\n  entertaining to read about, and a story element I really appreciate.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">It&#x2019;s the small\n  things that add up, and they can have a big difference how you perceive a story. The small things that make me enjoy\n  Uchikoshi&#x2019;s writing is how he always builds a story that has an amazing premise, and then creates an atmosphere that\n  is paralleled by few. <em> Ever 17</em> uses every aspect it has (including the perspective you play in!) to create an\n  experience that gets you absorbed in, and this starts with the writing. It&#x2019;s a story about being stuck in an\n  underwater theme park, and the way it&#x2019;s written makes you feel trapped. The killing of time, the occasional flooding,\n  the way it&#x2019;s written is a big part of the atmosphere it creates. Good world building is something I appreciate, and\n  the way <em>Ever 17</em> does it is solid, with these interesting characters tied to interesting concepts, building a\n  world with this beautiful water theme, and creating the feeling that you are trapped underwater.</p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQCAwX/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAAL/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAcNpeTMFJs//xAAaEAABBQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAREiFC/9oACAEBAAEFAkOWnLH/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ/9oACAEDAQE/AT//xAAVEQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQEf/aAAgBAgEBPwGH/8QAFxAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQEf/aAAgBAQAGPwI2tT//xAAZEAEBAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhQbH/2gAIAQEAAT8hFyDHGNkavcif/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABB4D//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEf/aAAgBAwEBPxCVr//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAEf/aAAgBAgEBPxBxCX//xAAaEAEAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABABExIWFx/9oACAEBAAE/EG05C6UB0332ABht3GFejQfSUnJ//9k=&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1306104798118680746\" title=\"1306104798118680746\" src=\"/static/df895b59bee0806243817ba90f44fd4f/1c72d/1306104798118680746.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/df895b59bee0806243817ba90f44fd4f/a80bd/1306104798118680746.jpg 148w,\n/static/df895b59bee0806243817ba90f44fd4f/1c91a/1306104798118680746.jpg 295w,\n/static/df895b59bee0806243817ba90f44fd4f/1c72d/1306104798118680746.jpg 590w,\n/static/df895b59bee0806243817ba90f44fd4f/a8a14/1306104798118680746.jpg 885w,\n/static/df895b59bee0806243817ba90f44fd4f/fbd2c/1306104798118680746.jpg 1180w,\n/static/df895b59bee0806243817ba90f44fd4f/eea4a/1306104798118680746.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Due to the routes being pretty similar to the others, your experiences add up,\nand you learn more and more about these characters and this world. When Coco’s route comes by, it uses everything you\nknow to blow you away like a roller coaster. The last route is intriguing, interesting, exhilarating, and amazing with\na glorious ending that answers almost any question you could throw at it. It’s one of the best I’ve seen. The ending\nis sort of like a Charles Dickens book, but not done in a dated way; everything’s wrapped up in a neat little bow,\ncreating a satisfying conclusion. The best part? If you want more, there is an audio novel that is like an\nepilogue.</p></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">All of these aspects culminate to create a well written story with lots of depth and\n  intrigue. Ever 17 is one of my favorite stories I&#x2019;ve ever experienced, and due to the writing, it was a blast to\n  experience. There&#x2019;s the pacing that may bother some out there, but I didn&#x2019;t really find anything wrong with it. I wish\n  every story was like this: extremely intriguing, extremely enjoyable, and extremely interesting.</p><h4 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h116523\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a><strong>Writing - 10/10 </strong></h4>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 12.162162162162163%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAIAAADXZGvcAAAACXBIWXMAAA9dAAAPXQGodBlAAAAAgklEQVQI12OwDW8JSO+PK5kZnDXRLLDeMbrdL7VPx7PSOabdOaaDTy9N3CxHzDRb3DxbQDfbIrag/Jr2iieVTfcNQzqSGCLzpzVMWl/asbxz5paClqUtUzZMXbwno3Z+SsWcnPqFvLqpEmDNEhbZ/Fp5DoWJnU+s3n1/OetZRMryAAB5BzMiCC7MkgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1306104798297618858\" title=\"1306104798297618858\" src=\"/static/b185a6a6755d82175581243969a8828f/fcda8/1306104798297618858.png\" srcset=\"/static/b185a6a6755d82175581243969a8828f/12f09/1306104798297618858.png 148w,\n/static/b185a6a6755d82175581243969a8828f/e4a3f/1306104798297618858.png 295w,\n/static/b185a6a6755d82175581243969a8828f/fcda8/1306104798297618858.png 590w,\n/static/b185a6a6755d82175581243969a8828f/9be90/1306104798297618858.png 636w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1306104798364933034\" title=\"1306104798364933034\" src=\"/static/378c571a10017d4227643af1fd0f1053/1c72d/1306104798364933034.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/378c571a10017d4227643af1fd0f1053/a80bd/1306104798364933034.jpg 148w,\n/static/378c571a10017d4227643af1fd0f1053/1c91a/1306104798364933034.jpg 295w,\n/static/378c571a10017d4227643af1fd0f1053/1c72d/1306104798364933034.jpg 590w,\n/static/378c571a10017d4227643af1fd0f1053/a8a14/1306104798364933034.jpg 885w,\n/static/378c571a10017d4227643af1fd0f1053/fbd2c/1306104798364933034.jpg 1180w,\n/static/378c571a10017d4227643af1fd0f1053/eea4a/1306104798364933034.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">As of writing this review,<em> Ever 17</em> is the second oldest visual novel I\nhave reviewed (The oldest being Tsukihime), originally coming out in 2002… and unlike what you would think, it hasn’t\naged that badly when it comes to Visuals.

I think <em>Ever 17</em> held up this well due to a solid art style, good artists working on it, and a level of polish that kept it from aging horribly. A beautifully styled work will age much better than one that goes for technological prowess.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">There are aspects that haven&#x2019;t aged so well however; the sprites and the fonts have not aged that well. The sprites at times can look unnatural in the environments they are in, and the font just looks old. Really though, these won&#x2019;t inhibit your enjoyment of the game at all, so it&#x2019;s nothing to worry about.</p> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8biltdXfwvo\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"8biltdXfwvo\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://8biltdXfwvo\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-8biltdXfwvo\"></span></span></div> <blockquote class=\"sc-8hxd3p-0 nvIqO\" data-type=\"BlockQuote\"><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><em>Yes, the gif was just a snippet of this OP.

The game is finally in glorious 16:9 HD (note that the art is just HD-ified art from the original release... that&#x2019;s how well this has aged) and the backgrounds look stunning, but the visuals did take a hit when it comes to character art: the horrible 3D models. These models look bad and the people who worked on them should feel bad. It looks like early PS2 polygon work, there&#x2019;s no detail in the models at all. If the sprites stood out from the visuals, these models are skyscrapers in the middle of nowhere. I personally believe that they are way worse than the sprites. These will not age well, and they should have stuck with sprites...</p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Ignoring the remake&#x2019;s horrible 3d models, the visuals in <em>Ever 17</em> have passed the test of time, and still look good today. This is a feat that many shows would dream of achieving, and it&#x2019;s an aspect I enjoy.</p><h4 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h116524\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a><strong>Visuals - 8/10</strong></h4> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 12.162162162162163%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAIAAADXZGvcAAAACXBIWXMAAA9dAAAPXQGodBlAAAAAeUlEQVQI12MwC6wPyZ7kk9IbljPZPKghMn8akJtcMccmrFnYKFPcLEfMNBuIxM2yBQ0yDQPLXRZ4tB/u8Frp4V6Ty2Ad2jR54a6suoU1fWvKO1fU9a+dvfJA39ztUQXThI2RNJtnC+hmmcUXe63wrN5T57LUOWhyOgAbAy9Q2eA1AwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span> <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1306104798550752170\" title=\"1306104798550752170\" src=\"/static/344f7e4fdecd801c0871b2d0a872e24a/fcda8/1306104798550752170.png\" srcset=\"/static/344f7e4fdecd801c0871b2d0a872e24a/12f09/1306104798550752170.png 148w, /static/344f7e4fdecd801c0871b2d0a872e24a/e4a3f/1306104798550752170.png 295w, /static/344f7e4fdecd801c0871b2d0a872e24a/fcda8/1306104798550752170.png 590w, /static/344f7e4fdecd801c0871b2d0a872e24a/9be90/1306104798550752170.png 636w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\"> </span> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zkvQte7JWpw\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"zkvQte7JWpw\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://zkvQte7JWpw\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-zkvQte7JWpw\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">The soundtrack in <em>Ever 17</em> is one of my favorite soundtracks out there: it&#x2019;s one of those soundtracks that are great in the game, but are so solid that you can listen to them at almost any time and they&#x2019;ll still be enjoyable. I&#x2019;ve never gotten tired of listening to the soundtrack in the game, and I doubt you will either.</p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">The soundtrack itself overall isn&#x2019;t particularly mind blowing, with most of it composed of atmospheric pieces, but it does have some standouts like Karma. The atmospheric nature is also an aspect of why the soundtrack is so good though; it&#x2019;s the atmosphere, a mood, and uses its music very well. In my opinion, music in media is made to manipulate the emotions, and along with the visuals, create a feeling of existence in the world. Due to the fact that we do not exist in these experiences, these works have to try absorbing us into the world by creating an atmosphere that is engaging and a mood that interests the viewer. <em>Ever 17 </em>has a soundtrack that does this atmosphere building to near perfection, and this soundtrack is a big part of that process. It really takes the writing and story up by a few levels, and creating a soundtrack like this is what every work should strive for.</p> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5K5PsF5Y2dM\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"5K5PsF5Y2dM\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://5K5PsF5Y2dM\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-5K5PsF5Y2dM\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">One of the best parts of this soundtrack is how it fits with the themes of the game, with a smooth, watery feel that helps make this soundtrack blend into the location. The happy and upbeat tracks like <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga=\"[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h99YYncmzeY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h99YYncmzeY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lemurianishce Ruine </a></span>sound bubbly and entertaining, the more normal tracks like <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga=\"[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K5PsF5Y2dM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K5PsF5Y2dM\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hologramm </a></span>sound smooth, the tracks like <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga=\"[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkvQte7JWpw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkvQte7JWpw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Karma</a></span> have a serene and calming feel, yet have the feelings it intends, and the intense tracks like <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga=\"[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiO3ZbyxQY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMiO3ZbyxQY\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IBF Notfall</a></span> are like water flooding in, with all the swiftness and dread that comes with it.

The voice actors do a pretty good job portraying the characters and the emotions that come with them, which I really appreciate. The sound clips seem like they have low sampling rates and are compressed a bit, but it doesn&#x2019;t really get in the way of your experience.</p> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pHIJz0Op6sc\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"pHIJz0Op6sc\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://pHIJz0Op6sc\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-pHIJz0Op6sc\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">When 5pb decided to remake <em>Ever 17</em> in 2011, they also decided to remake the soundtrack... and it&#x2019;s hit and miss. Some aspects are better, with more instruments, and cleaner sound... but a lot of the charm and smoothness from the original soundtrack is gone, which causes some tracks to sound worse in comparison (Insel null is a great example of this: <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga=\"[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjVzqA41neg&amp;list=PL3E52C022C271E4DD&amp;index=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjVzqA41neg&amp;list=PL3E52C022C271E4DD&amp;index=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">360</a></span> vs <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga=\"[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmuLlROPVLo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmuLlROPVLo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PC</a></span>) </p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Ignoring the crummy remixes, <em>Ever 17</em> has a soundtrack that I love.
