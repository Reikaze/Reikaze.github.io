Here’s my two cents on my\n  favorite anime of the year, my top anime of 2018.</p>\n<div class=\"bxm4mm-2 hKBnez js_video-sticky__top-limit\"></div>\n<div class=\"bxm4mm-4 fQqUFt\">\n<div class=\"bxm4mm-1 gKeXmA js_video-sticky-trigger\"></div>\n<div class=\"bxm4mm-0 jRTmst instream-native-video instream-permalink js_video-sticky-target instream-native-video--mobile\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bxm4mm-3 eCMXYG js_video-sticky__bottom-limit\"></div>\n<hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"/><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h103318\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id=\"\"></a>Rules\n</h2>\n<video autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\"><source src=\"/145176aa541006027b114a5c507e5f5d/agiz2alqtfoa2rrjhjw0.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"/></video>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">My rules of this list are simple: if it aired/released this year, it can go on this\n  list. I don’t see the point in only giving a show one chance during it’s airing season, and this is my list so I’ll\n  list my favorite shows regardless of what season it started on. If this means that one show hogs the top spot for 2\n  seasons, than good for that show! If it’s an OVA or movie that came out during the duration of the season I fell in\n  love with, then it may be there. I think that the seasonal split is arbitrary and unnecessary, so it’s completely gone\n  here. Sorry about that, but that’s how I’m doing it.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Just an FYI, the placement of\n  the show in the list is mostly based on my experience and enjoyment of the work, so if you’re wondering why something\n  isn’t where you think it should be or you can’t really tell via the justification, that’s probably why. Keep in mind,\n  just because a show is lower on the list doesn’t mean it’s bad - all of these are great, and a lower placement isn’t a\n  mark against the show, at this point it’s nearly all personal preference. With that out of the way, let’s get\n  started!</p>\n<hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h103319\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>Thoughts\n  on Anime in 2018:</h2>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"s3pokgn5cfihj5rzmeu9\" title=\"s3pokgn5cfihj5rzmeu9\" src=\"/static/e437a10d46ae85027c6cc02d2b7cc75e/1c72d/s3pokgn5cfihj5rzmeu9.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/e437a10d46ae85027c6cc02d2b7cc75e/a80bd/s3pokgn5cfihj5rzmeu9.jpg 148w,\n/static/e437a10d46ae85027c6cc02d2b7cc75e/1c91a/s3pokgn5cfihj5rzmeu9.jpg 295w,\n/static/e437a10d46ae85027c6cc02d2b7cc75e/1c72d/s3pokgn5cfihj5rzmeu9.jpg 590w,\n/static/e437a10d46ae85027c6cc02d2b7cc75e/a8a14/s3pokgn5cfihj5rzmeu9.jpg 885w,\n/static/e437a10d46ae85027c6cc02d2b7cc75e/fbd2c/s3pokgn5cfihj5rzmeu9.jpg 1180w,\n/static/e437a10d46ae85027c6cc02d2b7cc75e/e5166/s3pokgn5cfihj5rzmeu9.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">A part of this is my own circumstance, but a part of it was anime itself: while\n  there were some really great anime this year, and I absolutely adore a lot of the shows on this list, outside of this\n  there was only a handful of shows that actually kept my interest. Even if I had time to make the seasonal lists, I&#x2019;m\n  not quite sure if I would have been able to find enough shows to fill out the 5 I usually have per season.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">That being said, like 2017, there were some damn great movies that came out in 2018, and I\n  loved seeing them. <em>Liz and the Blue Bird, Maquia, Night is Short, Walk on Girl,</em> I enjoyed all of the anime\n  movies I went to see this year and some of them were just stunning. Shame I wasn&#x2019;t able to see Mirai, but I had a\n  great anime movie year.</p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">One thing about 2018 I did appreciate a lot however, is that because of the anime\n  that came out this year, I feel like I finally know what I enjoy in a work - it&#x2019;s all about the characters. Before I\n  thought I enjoyed works that focused on the story first and foremost, disregarding other elements to create a more\n  engaging work, but ultimately I&#x2019;ve learned that I can enjoy a show regardless of it&#x2019;s premise, so long as the\n  interactions between the characters are entertaining and engaging. While I do enjoy a good sci-fi or action show, well\n  written, realistic and complex characters are what I love for in a work, and I think this list definitely shows that,\n  at least up in the top.</p>\n<hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h103320\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>Honorable\n  Mention: <em>Steins;Gate 0</em></h2>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"ek9emd9tikrfp2vs5kab\" title=\"ek9emd9tikrfp2vs5kab\" src=\"/static/c4ccbe80cad5fa6612d2747132389a39/1c72d/ek9emd9tikrfp2vs5kab.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/c4ccbe80cad5fa6612d2747132389a39/a80bd/ek9emd9tikrfp2vs5kab.jpg 148w,\n/static/c4ccbe80cad5fa6612d2747132389a39/1c91a/ek9emd9tikrfp2vs5kab.jpg 295w,\n/static/c4ccbe80cad5fa6612d2747132389a39/1c72d/ek9emd9tikrfp2vs5kab.jpg 590w,\n/static/c4ccbe80cad5fa6612d2747132389a39/a8a14/ek9emd9tikrfp2vs5kab.jpg 885w,\n/static/c4ccbe80cad5fa6612d2747132389a39/fbd2c/ek9emd9tikrfp2vs5kab.jpg 1180w,\n/static/c4ccbe80cad5fa6612d2747132389a39/ac614/ek9emd9tikrfp2vs5kab.jpg 1272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Anime Made By: </strong>White Fox</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Genres: </strong>Sci-Fi,\n  Slice of Life, Drama, Thriller</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Summary: </strong>The eccentric,\n  self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe has become a shell of his former self. Depressed and traumatized after\n  failing to rescue his friend Makise Kurisu, he has decided to forsake his mad scientist alter ego and live as an\n  ordinary college student.

In front of a stunned crowd, Alexis and Maho unveil Amadeus&#x2014;a revolutionary AI capable of\n  storing a person&#x2019;s memories and creating a perfect simulation of that person complete with their personality and\n  quirks. Meeting with Maho and Alexis after the presentation, Okabe learns that the two were Kurisu&#x2019;s colleagues in\n  university, and that they have simulated her in Amadeus. Hired by Alexis to research the simulation&#x2019;s behavior, Okabe\n  is given the chance to interact with the shadow of a long-lost dear friend. Dangerously tangled in the past, Okabe\n  must face the harsh reality and carefully maneuver around the disastrous consequences that come with disturbing the\n  natural flow of time. <em>- Plot Summary from MAL </em><br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Justification and\n  Thoughts:</strong> Huh. If you told me before the show aired that <em>Steins;Gate 0</em> wouldn&#x2019;t make my top 10 list,\n  I probably wouldn&#x2019;t have believed you. I loved the <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga=\"[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-steins-gate-0-visual-novel-ps4-1790389958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]\" href=\"https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/rockmandash-reviews-steins-gate-0-visual-novel-ps4-1790389958\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visual Novel</a></span>\n  of Steins;Gate 0, and the anime definitely had it&#x2019;s moments, some even better than the VN, ... but the show rubbed me\n  the wrong way. A part of this might be that Steins;Gate 0 isn&#x2019;t as good as I thought it was or it might have been a\n  poor adaptation or it might have been fatigue since I played and reviewed the Visual Novel recently, but I just didn&#x2019;t\n  really enjoy it as much as when I played the Visual Novel or as much as I thought it would. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">This anime is still <em>Steins;Gate</em> so the strengths like the enjoyable cast,\n  the engaging science and fun slice of life still applies and honestly it&#x2019;s a better adaptation than I should have\n  expected. I think most would say that it&#x2019;s an objectively good anime, and you can see that from it&#x2019;s MAL score. It&#x2019;s\n  just that this is my list based on my enjoyment of the show and there were just moments that were either rushed or\n  incredibly dull during the anime to the point where I wasn&#x2019;t a big fan. The second half in my opinion is a bit all\n  over the place, too focused to cram new stuff or non-relevant aspects of the show instead of focusing on what makes\n  for enjoyable. Also to me, the strengths of <em>Steins;Gate 0</em> is how it manages to convey Okabe&#x2019;s downtrodden\n  feeling after the events unfolded, but the anime doesn&#x2019;t really do that element of the work justice. It&#x2019;s a shame, but\n  what are you gonna do. :c</p>\n<hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h103321\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>10.<em> A\n  Place Further than the Universe</em></h2>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.75675675675676%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDBP/EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMBAv/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAAB3zomzQQif//EABoQAAIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhESE0P/2gAIAQEAAQUCpijsye0W+duv/8QAGBEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEERL/2gAIAQMBAT8BwKPZ/8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAETEf/aAAgBAgEBPwGmF2f/xAAbEAEAAQUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMQECESFxcv/aAAgBAQAGPwKWkrvLKnH/xAAdEAADAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREhMUFhgZHB/9oACAEBAAE/IXraOdkFryW9P7IlPhPolmyNza66Z//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQzx//xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABH/2gAIAQMBAT8QykA0b//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERAP/aAAgBAgEBPxClkWTf/8QAGxABAAMBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITFBgcH/2gAIAQEAAT8Q0vBbegjLkuvCTuEc8RTAMFciol1vyvwjHYSX1n//2Q==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"bzfaijv8y2po4tmbpn99\" title=\"bzfaijv8y2po4tmbpn99\" src=\"/static/703bed2001119523a8317dc7a552d15b/1c72d/bzfaijv8y2po4tmbpn99.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/703bed2001119523a8317dc7a552d15b/a80bd/bzfaijv8y2po4tmbpn99.jpg 148w,\n/static/703bed2001119523a8317dc7a552d15b/1c91a/bzfaijv8y2po4tmbpn99.jpg 295w,\n/static/703bed2001119523a8317dc7a552d15b/1c72d/bzfaijv8y2po4tmbpn99.jpg 590w,\n/static/703bed2001119523a8317dc7a552d15b/a8a14/bzfaijv8y2po4tmbpn99.jpg 885w,\n/static/703bed2001119523a8317dc7a552d15b/d60a6/bzfaijv8y2po4tmbpn99.jpg 954w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Anime Made By: </strong>Madhouse<br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">\n<strong>Genres: </strong>Adventure, &#x201C;Cute Girls Doing Cute Things&#x201D;</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot\n  Summary: </strong>Mari Tamaki is second year high school student, who never did anything memorable in her life.

It&#x2019;s tangentially related to <em>Sound Euphonium</em>, but other than the setting and cameo appearances from characters in <em>Sound</em>, it doesn&#x2019;t really relate to that work so there&#x2019;s no real excuse not to watch this movie if it sounds appealing - it&#x2019;s a great work that you should try to go and see.</p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h103323\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>8.<em> Hinamatsuri</em><br></h2> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span> <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"kyojx84vwbiq3mil0s2o\" title=\"kyojx84vwbiq3mil0s2o\" src=\"/static/d47a27ad88266b44477d38a20ca62fd7/1c72d/kyojx84vwbiq3mil0s2o.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/d47a27ad88266b44477d38a20ca62fd7/a80bd/kyojx84vwbiq3mil0s2o.jpg 148w, /static/d47a27ad88266b44477d38a20ca62fd7/1c91a/kyojx84vwbiq3mil0s2o.jpg 295w, /static/d47a27ad88266b44477d38a20ca62fd7/1c72d/kyojx84vwbiq3mil0s2o.jpg 590w, /static/d47a27ad88266b44477d38a20ca62fd7/d4b53/kyojx84vwbiq3mil0s2o.jpg 853w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\"> </span> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Anime Made By: </strong>feel.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Genres: </strong>Comedy, Sci-fi, Seinen, Slice of Life, Supernatural </p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Summary: </strong>Yakuza member Yoshifumi Nitta is lounging around his apartment, admiring his vase collection, when a giant metal capsule appears from thin air and knocks him on the head.

The music is phenomenal, the cast is outstanding, the drama is engaging and emotional, the character development was a joy to watch and the visuals were top notch. I loved the show and have no real gripes about it. Really underappreciated show since it was trapped in the hell that is HiDIVE, with lots of twists and turns that I enjoyed.

When I was younger, I used to watch almost nothing but mecha, but as time went by, the amount of mecha and the quality of mecha seemed to wither. Given this, it was really refreshing to see a quality mecha that echos the ones I used to adore so much. A mecha action sci-fi that doesn&#x2019;t take itself too seriously, is an enjoyable watch throughout, has great action, has a great cast, and has a rocking soundtrack, what else would you want from a show?

This spiritual successor to <em>Tatami Galaxy</em> was frankly everything I could have hoped for out of an anime movie - an over the top, wacky and fun romance that knows what is does and nails every bit of execution throughout. I loved the quirky and memorable cast, the wacky events that were going on, the uniquely Yuasa presentation that absolutely fits the work, basically every part of the viewing experience was a blast. It&#x2019;s a consistently engaging, fun watch that ended up as one of my favorites of the year.

The music was great and the presentation was solid, but\n  while the name might make you assume this show is trash, the best part of <em>Bunny Girl </em>is the characters, and\n  oh boy, this cast was great. So many of these shows have extremely shallow characters, basically walking archetypes,\n  but with <em>Bunny girl</em> we got multidimensional characters, a cast that had depth and acted like actual humans\n  instead of tsunderes or something like that. <em>Bunny Senpai</em> is like the perfect blend of <em>Monogatari</em>\n  and <em>SNAFU</em>, structured like the best parts of <em>Monogatari </em>and focused in supernatural phenomenon but\n  having the character depth that made <em>SNAFU</em> so great.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">The relationship\n  between Sakuta and Mai was something special. Both characters on their own were phenominal, but seeing them interact,\n  talk problems out and have a healthy relationship with banter that was just phenomenal, really what i&#x2019;d love to see in\n  every show. It takes a show like bunny girl to get you to appreciate how important idle banter between characters is\n  in regards to one&#x2019;s enjoyment of a show given how it fills your moment to moment experience, and after watching the\n  show, I definitely won&#x2019;t take it for granted. </p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"> Each arc of <em>Bunny Girl</em> was great and I thoroughly enjoyed the show\n  throughout, but the standout was at the end with Kaede&#x2019;s arc. I don&#x2019;t think i&#x2019;ve changed my opinion on a character so\n  fast, but the way they executed that arc was phenomenal and I can&#x2019;t wait for more. Onto the movie!!! Absolutely loved\n  <em>Bunny Girl</em>, and it stands as one of my favorite anime i&#x2019;ve seen, ever. Probably in my top 25 of all time.</p>\n<hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h103330\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>1. <em>Yuru\n  Camp</em></h2>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 54.72972972972974%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"ivjl6iednbc5iiofaqvd\" title=\"ivjl6iednbc5iiofaqvd\" src=\"/static/6b09fd5c879e0eea29f4b29e4103defa/fcda8/ivjl6iednbc5iiofaqvd.png\" srcset=\"/static/6b09fd5c879e0eea29f4b29e4103defa/12f09/ivjl6iednbc5iiofaqvd.png 148w,\n/static/6b09fd5c879e0eea29f4b29e4103defa/e4a3f/ivjl6iednbc5iiofaqvd.png 295w,\n/static/6b09fd5c879e0eea29f4b29e4103defa/fcda8/ivjl6iednbc5iiofaqvd.png 590w,\n/static/6b09fd5c879e0eea29f4b29e4103defa/efc66/ivjl6iednbc5iiofaqvd.png 885w,\n/static/6b09fd5c879e0eea29f4b29e4103defa/c83ae/ivjl6iednbc5iiofaqvd.png 1180w,\n/static/6b09fd5c879e0eea29f4b29e4103defa/229ad/ivjl6iednbc5iiofaqvd.png 1356w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Anime Made By: </strong>C-Station<br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">\n<strong>Genres: </strong>Slice of Life, Comedy, &#x201C;Cute Girls Doing Cute Things&#x201D;</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">\n<strong>Plot Summary: </strong>Rin is a young high school girl and solo camping enthusiast.

To me, the best slice of life shows do more than just comedy and day to day life- they\n  have an almost uncanny, amazing ability to capture a raw feeling and present that feeling in a manner that provides\n  pure bliss to the viewer. In this regard,<em> Yuru Camp </em>is an almost quintessential example of a great SoL. Sure,\n  I could rattle off <em>Yuru Camp</em>&#x2019;s great points like how I really enjoyed the well rounded cast, the jokes were\n  really funny, I loved the presentation, the opening is catchy as all hell, etc but this wouldn&#x2019;t even come close to\n  why <em>Yuru Camp</em> is such a great show.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><em>Yuru Camp</em> captures the\n  excitement that goes into camping perfectly - the wonder of the nice views that you see along the way, the\n  anticipation from the escape from normality, the fun times of looking at the stuff you&#x2019;ll need to buy for the trip,\n  and then actually getting to your destination and having a great time. Even if you&#x2019;re not a fan of camping, it&#x2019;s gonna\n  convey this feeling to you, reminding of what it&#x2019;s like to go traveling with your goofball friends as they do silly\n  things, having a great time. The feeling of adventure, the feeling of seeing cool and unknown places with all the\n  quirks that comes with that, and the feeling of just having a great time by yourself or with friends: every moment\n  <em>Yuru Camp </em>is pure bliss, enjoyable and relaxing to make your day all that much better. Add to this Nadeshiko\n  being my spirit animal that put a smile on my face throughout, and I have to say... I love <em>Yuru Camp</em> and it&#x2019;s\n  my AOTY of 2018, and one of my favorite anime I&#x2019;ve ever seen.</p>\n<hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"/><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><em>Thank you for reading!
