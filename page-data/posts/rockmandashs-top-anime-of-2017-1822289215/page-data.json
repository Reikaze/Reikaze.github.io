I don&#x2019;t see the point in only giving a show one chance during it&#x2019;s airing season, and this is my list so I&#x2019;ll\n  list my favorite shows regardless of what season it started on. If this means that one show hogs the top spot for 2\n  seasons, than good for that show! If it&#x2019;s an OVA or movie that came out during the duration of the season I fell in\n  love with, then it may be there. I think that the seasonal split is arbitrary and unnecessary, so it&#x2019;s completely gone\n  here. Sorry about that, but that&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;m doing it.<br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><br>Just an FYI, the\n  placement of the show in the list is mostly based on my experience and enjoyment of the work, so if you&#x2019;re wondering\n  why something isn&#x2019;t where you think it should be or you can&#x2019;t really tell via the justification, that&#x2019;s probably why.\n  Keep in mind, just because a show is lower on the list doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s bad - all of these are great, and a lower\n  placement isn&#x2019;t a mark against the show, at this point it&#x2019;s nearly all personal preference.

After the amazing winter season, there was nothing that really grabbed me, nothing that kept me consistently watching anime and as a result, I lapsed in my anime watching significantly. A part of this is due to the fact that many shows I was interested were locked in the double paywall that was amazon strike, which as a poor college student I really couldn&#x2019;t justify paying for. I could pirate, sure, but I don&#x2019;t typically watch on a laptop or desktop, and mobile apps and sites for pirating services usually suck ass... so I just watched less anime. RIP<br><br>That being said, there were some damn great movies that came out in 2017, and I loved seeing them.<em> Fate/stay night Heaven&#x2019;s feel</em>, <em>Silent Voice</em> &amp;<em> Your Name.</em> (which I think of it more as a 2016 anime bc saw at AX and thus won&#x2019;t be on this list) were all fantastic and as someone who loves anime movies I hope other years will be as great as this was for anime movies. </p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h104284\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>Honorable Mention: <em>Ancient Magus Bride</em></h3> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zuW_qSQXFx0\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"zuW_qSQXFx0\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://zuW_qSQXFx0\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-zuW_qSQXFx0\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Anime Made By: </strong>Wit Studio</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"> <strong>Genres:</strong> Slice of Life, Magic, Fantasy</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Summary:</strong> Chise Hatori, an unloved and depressed orphan who has seen strange monsters all her life, sells herself at auction to the highest bidder in an attempt to find a place where she will be wanted, even as a trophy.

Now, he wants to have a chance of providing the same experience for others by creating his own game, but unfortunately, Tomoya cannot do this task by himself.</p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">He successfully recruits childhood friend Eriri Spencer Sawamura to illustrate and literary elitist Utaha Kasumigaoka to write the script for his visual novel, while he directs. Super-group now in hand, Tomoya only needs an inspiration to base his project on, and luckily meets the beautiful, docile Megumi Katou, who he then models his main character after.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Using what knowledge he has, Tomoya creates a new doujin circle with hopes to touch the hearts of those who play their game. What he does not realize, is that to invoke these emotions, the creators have had to experience the same feelings in their own lives.<strong><em> - Plot Summary from MAL</em></strong></p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong><em>Saekano </em>is my jam, and one of my favorite series to come out of the last few years. As a person who loves Visual Novels, loves to hear about people making things, loves romantic comedies and loves dramas, <em>Saekano</em> is the exact type of show I would fall in love with, and thanks to it&#x2019;s absolutely fantastic execution, I certainly have. Add to the fact that <em>Saekano </em>shares shares many of the strengths that made White Album 2 great because they were made by the same person (Maruto Fumiaki) and what you have left is a very compelling and enjoyable watch, one I fell in love with.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">While at the beginning Season 2 seemed like more of<em> Best Girl: The Animation</em> with entertaining dialogue, harem antics and meta humor all over the place (which I still loved, mind you because its damn enjoyable), Season 2 finally kicked into what one would expect from Maruto Fumiaki. In <em>Saekano S2</em>, everything about the perfect harem setting starts to fall apart, and in it&#x2019;s place we have a fantastic and engaging drama that is built on well developed characters in an engaging premise. We see everything we loved from the first season be enhanced while <em>Saekano</em> becomes a much better show as a whole with more meaningful interactions between characters and a more gripping story in general. This is a work that shows the viewer the impacts of what it means to put your heart and soul into a creative process, what it means to work with others as a team, on creating something and the impacts of working in a team on such a creative work has as a whole. Ultimately, it&#x2019;s still not a<em> White Album 2</em> of romantic perfection as it still overdosing on ecchi and silly antics given it&#x2019;s harem meta anime roots, but it&#x2019;s one of my favorite anime, and I definitely encourage you to give it a shot if you think you&#x2019;d be interested in it.</p> </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h104287\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>6.<em> Fate/stay night Heaven&#x2019;s Feel Presage Flower</em></h3> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AMr5pXzpvP0\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"AMr5pXzpvP0\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://AMr5pXzpvP0\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-AMr5pXzpvP0\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Anime Made By: </strong>Ufotable</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"> <strong>Genres: </strong>Action, Magic, Fantasy, Supernatural, Shounen </p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Summary: </strong><em>Fate/stay night </em>follows Emiya Shirou as he is dragged into a fight-to-the-death tournament called The Fifth Holy Grail War, where people known as Masters fight with heroes throughout history, known as Servants, for a chance to get the wish-granting Holy Grail.

Like the character Tanya herself, Saga of Tanya the Evil the show overcame all exceptions, even as the system was rigged against it&#x2019;s favor. A show with a loli as a main character in a boring and grey war show, made with a brand new studio... nothing good could have come out of it, but it managed to be amazing. What we got was a fascinating alternate history twist on world war 1 with our main character not being your typical little girl, but a deeply logical Japanese businessman turned into a little girl and facing a relentless battle against god, aka being X! Seeing this conflict was extremely entertaining, adding onto the enjoyment that comes from Tanya as a character, and the amazingly animated fights bring the show into another level, with this being one of my favorite action anime of the year.

Even though I saw the source though, that didn&#x2019;t lessen the impact of the work for me: KyoAni pulled some movie magic and made a gripping and compelling work, great in basically every way except one. <br><br>For me, the pinnacle of a movie experience is being immersed in a human story, and when I witnessed the believable characters faced in a gut wrenching yet ultimately realistic situation, I couldn&#x2019;t help but felt engaged and entranced, to the point that I was crying in the theaters. The production values were absolutely supurb as KyoAni on a movie budget lead to some absolutely jaw dropping scenes, the voice acting, while not to everyone&#x2019;s tastes was very effective, and the story was compelling and thought provoking, getting me to walk out of the theaters thinking about how actions effect the lives of others. My one real issue with the movie though, is that it&#x2019;s a movie: the story is structured in a serialized manner, and the adaptation can&#x2019;t change that. So, what we got with the movie adaptation of Silent voice was a series of peaks and valleys, with no real satisfying rising action in the story. It felt like KyoAni should have made this a TV anime, but it&#x2019;s still a great movie and a must watch.<br></p> </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h104290\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>3. <em>Descending Stories: Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju S2 </em></h3> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vGx7u3hMCOA\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"vGx7u3hMCOA\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://vGx7u3hMCOA\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-vGx7u3hMCOA\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Anime Made By:</strong> Studio Deen<br><br><strong>Genre: </strong>Drama, Historical<br><br><strong>Plot Summary:</strong> Following the conclusion of rakugo practitioner Yakumo Yurakutei VIII&#x2019;s dramatic story of his past growing up under the names Bon and Kikuhiko and his tumultuous friendship with fellow rakugo trainee Sukeroku Yurakutei II and relationship with the geisha Miyokichi, the story shifts to Yakumo&#x2019;s student Yotaro as he takes on the title of Sukeroku Yurakutei III.

Season 1 was phenomenal; a beautiful and extremely well executed historical drama that absolutely took me and the AniTAY community by surprise. While <em>Rakugo</em>&#x2019;s premise might not strike you as something you&#x2019;d be interested in watching because it&#x2019;s simply telling stories, where <em>Rakugo </em>shines is the brilliant execution: how it tells the story is what that makes this great, being able to handle all of its elements extremely well. The show has fantastic pacing, solid visuals, a great score, amazing characters and the best part: it&#x2019;s consistently engaging with every episode being better than the last.<br><br>Season 2 was more of<em> Rakugo </em>Season 1 which is great, but Season 2 made a fundamental change that takes away from what made me love the show so much, thus the placement at 3 for this year. Season 1 of R<em>akugo </em>was a historical set piece, a flashback to a time when master Yakumo was growing up, in one of my favorite settings. Going from a historical coming of age to a more modern story following a yotaro/former criminal as he does rakugo... it wasn&#x2019;t exactly what I was hoping for. Definitely worth a watch, and the ending is phenomenal, but it isn&#x2019;t as golden as Rakugo Season 1.</p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h104291\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>2. <em>KonoSuba: God&#x2019;s Blessing on This Wonderful World! 2 </em></h3> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vMmPAMM87QQ\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"vMmPAMM87QQ\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://vMmPAMM87QQ\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-vMmPAMM87QQ\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Anime Made By: </strong>Studio Deen<br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Genre: </strong>Comedy, Slice of Life, Isekai/Another World</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Summary: </strong><em>Konosuba</em> tells the story of Kazuma, a shut-in otaku NEET.

It ticks a lot of boxes: <em>Girls Last Tour</em> is a fantastic post apocalyptic slice of life adventure (things I would enjoy by themselves) and thanks to an absolutely amazing execution, we got an incredibly fun yet meaningful show to watch. The slice of life that makes the show feel easy to digest, but it&#x2019;s also fascinating and engaging in a meaningful manner thanks to the post apocalyptic setting that is thought provoking and keeps you asking questions throughout. The real core of the story is the characters though, like all good slice of life shows are: while we only really focus on our 2 lead characters, they felt like real human beings in a fascinating situation of growing up in a post apocalyptic setting, really unknown about how the world works due to the lack of information in that era, and their interactions between each other were some of the most enjoyable and entertaining I&#x2019;ve seen all year. </p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"> It&#x2019;s production is amazing too. The music perfectly captures the atmosphere and mood of the world and scenes it has, the ops and eds are some of the most memorable I&#x2019;ve seen, and the visuals are surprisingly good. Ultimately this show looks a bit basic due to the moe blob art style (which I actually loved because it served to get me to love the characters more as I thought it was very fitting and endearing), but the world that<em> GLT</em> portrays is absolutely jaw dropping at times and it has some of the best visual directing I&#x2019;ve seen in anime. The way that they tease the next topic by hiding it on screen in previous scenes, the way they they provide visual information in a natural manner is superb and lead to <em>Girls&#x2019; Last Tour</em> looking way better than it&#x2019;s blobs suggest it should be.<br> But if you asked me what was the best part about <em>Girls&#x2019; Last Tour</em>, I would have to say how consistently compelling it is. At all moments, this work is compelling, endearing, entertaining and engaging - never was there a moment that I didn&#x2019;t enjoy with this work (both actually watching the show or thinking about the mysteries that the show constructs). So many of the decisions made in this show fit exactly what I love, and I loved this show to no end.
