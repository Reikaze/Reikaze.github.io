The fanservice that intros the show fades\n  away to be replaced by a hammy drama ( this show was VERY HAMMY AT TIMES). This is a show that puts hard work, effort\n  and dreams in a ring with Brilliant raw talent. Guess who wins? Brilliant people are something to admire, but how does\n  the radiance they have effect you? Take that concept, add romantic comedies and eccentric personalities, and you got\n  Sakurasou. Not what you were expecting, eh? Well it certainly was not what I was expecting. Sakurasou as a show, isn’t\n  bad, but the messages it sent with the decisions it made, pissed me off. The execution of marginalizing everything\n  that wasn’t blessed, pissed me off (ex: everybody but the main cast, The guy Aoyama rejected, etc.)</p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1238150483348935014\" title=\"1238150483348935014\" src=\"/static/976bf7ca99e8fc364ea4b6aeedf664e9/1c72d/1238150483348935014.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/976bf7ca99e8fc364ea4b6aeedf664e9/a80bd/1238150483348935014.jpg 148w,\n/static/976bf7ca99e8fc364ea4b6aeedf664e9/1c91a/1238150483348935014.jpg 295w,\n/static/976bf7ca99e8fc364ea4b6aeedf664e9/1c72d/1238150483348935014.jpg 590w,\n/static/976bf7ca99e8fc364ea4b6aeedf664e9/a8a14/1238150483348935014.jpg 885w,\n/static/976bf7ca99e8fc364ea4b6aeedf664e9/fbd2c/1238150483348935014.jpg 1180w,\n/static/976bf7ca99e8fc364ea4b6aeedf664e9/eea4a/1238150483348935014.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">I think that the story of friendship and that you can get through anything as\nlong as you have a person with you that can support you was beautiful, but the message that the journey is more\nimportant than the results is something I’ll never admit to. People’s success and failures guide who we are. The main\nmessage this show has is something I’ve personally believed in a long time: Effort isn’t everything. The message of\naccepting failure and accepting your place in life is something I’m still trying to deal with, and I’m sure many of\nyou are too. Put on face value, these are great lessons in life, but the way Sakurasou goes out of it’s way to bring\nthe worth of effort up and then throw it out into the streets, beat it up, kick it, burn it until it’s crisp, and make\neffort and dreams of a not brilliant person the most pointless and futile thing in existence under the hands of pure\nand raw talent, pissed me off. It hurt, especially after they show how important it is to the characters.</p></p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1238150483380364902\" title=\"1238150483380364902\" src=\"/static/72bd7c4305ceee63b20e4964bc41033f/1c72d/1238150483380364902.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/72bd7c4305ceee63b20e4964bc41033f/a80bd/1238150483380364902.jpg 148w,\n/static/72bd7c4305ceee63b20e4964bc41033f/1c91a/1238150483380364902.jpg 295w,\n/static/72bd7c4305ceee63b20e4964bc41033f/1c72d/1238150483380364902.jpg 590w,\n/static/72bd7c4305ceee63b20e4964bc41033f/a8a14/1238150483380364902.jpg 885w,\n/static/72bd7c4305ceee63b20e4964bc41033f/fbd2c/1238150483380364902.jpg 1180w,\n/static/72bd7c4305ceee63b20e4964bc41033f/eea4a/1238150483380364902.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Yes, at equal skill levels, the one who puts the most effort into the work will\ndo better, but in real life there are conditions that will sway how successful you are. Connections, raw talent, the\nsurroundings around you, personality, memory, competition, etc, there are so many elements that limits the level of\nsuccess you can have. I’m one of those nerdy honors kids, but in my honors classes, I’ve never been the best. I’ve\nalways have been one to try my hardest to do the best I can when I truly care about it, when it comes to school or\nthese reviews. I personally believe that I worked hard to get where I was, and to see a show use inspiration and\neffort to lead the viewer just to have that shining effort and progression smashed, was heartbreaking. I loved the\nride to that, it was my beliefs wrapped up in a funny package. But then they crushed it. The representations of my\nhopes, my dreams, and my actions crushed within a day. Yeah yeah, you could see it a mile away. Yeah yeah, the\ncharacters all rebounded, gave it their all, and were better for it. But what message does that send to the people who\ntry and consistently fail, or to those who don’t have those friends that can push them back up? Brush it off and\ncontinue compete with people way above your league until you break? Have the popular and brilliant save the day when\nyour futile efforts slowly fade away? That was the message the show sent to me, not the chasing your dreams until you\nfind your place message that it was supposed to send. At the end, the shipping of Mashirou over Nanami was just\npushing that idea, that brilliant radiance wins all. </p></p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAALABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMBBAX/xAAVAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAv/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABRFYpoihP/8QAGxAAAgEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIAAxMhIzL/2gAIAQEAAQUCubnqhiERg3b5Jn//xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABECH/2gAIAQMBAT8BHJ//xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEBH/2gAIAQIBAT8BTZ//xAAZEAEBAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAAECcWH/2gAIAQEABj8CDU9kJLaxyxy//8QAGxAAAgMAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERIVExgbH/2gAIAQEAAT8hcmpPBXOkJCBA50VdxzGEUUcH/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABD4P//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAIf/aAAgBAwEBPxADRJt//8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAR/9oACAECAQE/EFRkJf/EABoQAQEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExQVH/2gAIAQEAAT8QC1C9w9W/c2fiAy+uayxdt5xHvGulgITRgmSCnc//2Q==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1238150483449112166\" title=\"1238150483449112166\" src=\"/static/bff1684809dec6132234dc9f2104706c/1c72d/1238150483449112166.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/bff1684809dec6132234dc9f2104706c/a80bd/1238150483449112166.jpg 148w,\n/static/bff1684809dec6132234dc9f2104706c/1c91a/1238150483449112166.jpg 295w,\n/static/bff1684809dec6132234dc9f2104706c/1c72d/1238150483449112166.jpg 590w,\n/static/bff1684809dec6132234dc9f2104706c/a8a14/1238150483449112166.jpg 885w,\n/static/bff1684809dec6132234dc9f2104706c/fbd2c/1238150483449112166.jpg 1180w,\n/static/bff1684809dec6132234dc9f2104706c/eea4a/1238150483449112166.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">In many ways, I think I’m a lot like Nanami: I’m a try hard, I’m relatively smart\nbut I don’t shine like others, I have family that is opposed to what I love and what I want to do, I’m a crybaby, and\nI’m a relatively boring person who tries to take most things seriously. Almost every flaw that Nanami has, you could\nprobably find in me. (Yes, this means I can be horrible at times. This post is probably just that; Me being a horrible\nperson.) I fell in love with Nanami as a character, and seeing her dreams and chances crushed, was like crushing my\nown dreams. You can tell me I need to get over it, the journey is more important... But seeing dreams crushed like\nthat is depressing. I was rooting for Nanami the whole time, and seeing the show ship it the way it did... I’m pissed.\nEverything I was hoping to happen in this show, didn’t. A good example of this is the fact that I love good endings.\nThis ending, made me feel burned. The ending while technically fantastic wrapping everything up well, leaving you\nwanting more and having a slight epilogue, just didn’t do it for me. The ending ended it off with Sorata and Nanami’s\nsituation still being kinda being bad, and Mashirou essentially getting everything she wanted.</p></p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1238150483556722278\" title=\"1238150483556722278\" src=\"/static/167514613ca4854f8e900af58435a507/1c72d/1238150483556722278.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/167514613ca4854f8e900af58435a507/a80bd/1238150483556722278.jpg 148w,\n/static/167514613ca4854f8e900af58435a507/1c91a/1238150483556722278.jpg 295w,\n/static/167514613ca4854f8e900af58435a507/1c72d/1238150483556722278.jpg 590w,\n/static/167514613ca4854f8e900af58435a507/a8a14/1238150483556722278.jpg 885w,\n/static/167514613ca4854f8e900af58435a507/fbd2c/1238150483556722278.jpg 1180w,\n/static/167514613ca4854f8e900af58435a507/eea4a/1238150483556722278.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">This show loves it’s radiance and putting the normal people in despair.

When Sorata said to apologize to people who put effort, I was actually hoping a\nsincere apology, but of course knowing Mashiro and the show, that was way too much to ask for. This is a common theme\nwith the show, it made me question if the effort is worth it. Seeing this consistent failure One of the icings on the\ntop of the cake was the letter from the game company asking Mashirou to do art, while right after rejecting Sorata.\nThat was the show saying FUCK YOUUUU to Sorata, and sanity. Even if you have no interest in what we do, even if you\ndon’t have passion, because of your raw talent, we want you. That may be life, but that just BURNSSS. I haven’t been\nthis upset or pissed at a show in a long time. This took a representation of life, and shattered it. Unlike the main\ncharacters though, Many people probably won’t have a Sakurasou when they eventually crash and burn. This show made me\ncry. This show made me cry in ways I’ve never cried due to a show before. This crushed dreams, and told me that normal\npeople aren’t good enough. This show made me cry due to my personal sadness, and I’ve never seen a form of media do\nthat before.</p></p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1238150483624532838\" title=\"1238150483624532838\" src=\"/static/094e18e57f518aaf79e6681be35ec9b8/1c72d/1238150483624532838.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/094e18e57f518aaf79e6681be35ec9b8/a80bd/1238150483624532838.jpg 148w,\n/static/094e18e57f518aaf79e6681be35ec9b8/1c91a/1238150483624532838.jpg 295w,\n/static/094e18e57f518aaf79e6681be35ec9b8/1c72d/1238150483624532838.jpg 590w,\n/static/094e18e57f518aaf79e6681be35ec9b8/a8a14/1238150483624532838.jpg 885w,\n/static/094e18e57f518aaf79e6681be35ec9b8/72e01/1238150483624532838.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><br/>It’s the journey that matters not the results, right?

Maybe I have rose tinted glasses at me hoping for everything to go well. Maybe I\nlove the cliches a bit too much. Yes, this stuff is ignored by every other romance show. <strong>BUT THAT’S BECAUSE\nTHIS IS NOT WHAT MAKES AN ENJOYABLE SHOW</strong>. If this was a review, and I had to give a personal enjoyment\nrating, I’d give it less than 4 because the despair made me hate it. It was not up my alley.

Making shows that make me have strong feelings twords\n  (and this time against) a show. This is a show that made me smile, laugh, but most importantly, despair. If there’s\n  anything that’s a deconstruction of the moe romance genre, we have it right here. This is a show that prides itself on\n  ideals, the less normal and more brilliant you are, the better. If you are a normal person wishing to succeed, you are\n  going to crash and burn. How can I like a show that is refusing hopes and dreams? No matter how excellent they execute\n  it, any show that believes in that is just not for me, and I’ll hate it. </p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Sakurasou is the first Romantic Comedy that caused me to despair.","published":"July 10, 2014","tags":["rockmandash rambles","sakurasou","the pet girl at sakura hall","hate","personally"],"description":null,"oldArticle":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin Mai","id":"reikaze","description":"Hello!
