From\n  lackluster to top heavy (my personal favorite), there&#x2019;s all sorts of seasons but this spring season is one that most\n  people rather enjoy: The all around quality season. In a season like this, there&#x2019;s no real show that will blow you\n  away, but everything&#x2019;s pretty great. It has the side effect of making lists like this more boring and less likely to\n  find a personal favorite, but lots of people love it because there&#x2019;s always something interesting to watch. This\n  season was a noticeable example of this type of season in particular because <strong>*SO MUCH STUFF WAS GOOD*</strong>.\n  Even in just the AniTAY community, there were people saying this was the best and most enjoyable season they&#x2019;ve seen,\n  which is saying something. That&#x2019;s not my position, but it was a great season and there were a lot of great shows to\n  watch. <br></p>\n<hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h2 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h105977\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>Rules\n</h2>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"ig64enkwgcewpdo9nb3q\" title=\"ig64enkwgcewpdo9nb3q\" src=\"/static/187687dc94eedd938ad79b951929e7af/fcda8/ig64enkwgcewpdo9nb3q.png\" srcset=\"/static/187687dc94eedd938ad79b951929e7af/12f09/ig64enkwgcewpdo9nb3q.png 148w,\n/static/187687dc94eedd938ad79b951929e7af/e4a3f/ig64enkwgcewpdo9nb3q.png 295w,\n/static/187687dc94eedd938ad79b951929e7af/fcda8/ig64enkwgcewpdo9nb3q.png 590w,\n/static/187687dc94eedd938ad79b951929e7af/efc66/ig64enkwgcewpdo9nb3q.png 885w,\n/static/187687dc94eedd938ad79b951929e7af/d9199/ig64enkwgcewpdo9nb3q.png 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">My rules of this list are simple: if it aired/released this season, it can go on\n  this list. I don&#x2019;t see the point in only giving a show one chance during it&#x2019;s airing season, and this is my list so\n  I&#x2019;ll list my favorite shows regardless of what season it started on. If this means that one show hogs the top spot for\n  2 seasons, than good for that show! If it&#x2019;s an OVA or movie that came out during the duration of the season I fell in\n  love with, then it may be there. Also, I think that the seasonal split is arbitrary and unnecessary, so it&#x2019;s\n  completely gone here. Sorry about that, but that&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;m doing it.<br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><br>Just an\n  FYI, the placement of the show in the list is mostly based on my experience and enjoyment of the work, so if you&#x2019;re\n  wondering why something isn&#x2019;t where you think it should be or you can&#x2019;t really tell via the justification, that&#x2019;s\n  probably why. Keep in mind, just because a show is lower on the list doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s bad - all of these are great,\n  and a lower placement isn&#x2019;t a mark against the show, at this point it&#x2019;s nearly all personal preference.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h4 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h105978\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a><strong>Dishonorable Mention:<em> Re:Zero</em></strong></h4> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UWjiUPTtgDA\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"UWjiUPTtgDA\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://UWjiUPTtgDA\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-UWjiUPTtgDA\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Made by: </strong>White Fox</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"> <strong>Genre:</strong> Drama, Fantasy </p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Summary: </strong>On the way back from the local convenience store, high school student Subaru Natsuki is suddenly transported to another world and finds himself in a town straight out of your typical fantasy RPG. Burning with excitement, he explores the town, only to be attacked by a group of thugs. To his surprise, he is saved by a mysterious silver-haired girl, and Subaru decides to return the favor by helping the girl search for her stolen insignia. When they finally manage to get a lead, Subaru and the girl are killed before they can find the culprit or insignia. Subaru then awakens in the same place he started, except his injuries are gone and the girl is nowhere to be found. He discovers that by dying, he is able to return to a certain point in time&#x2014;an ability he dubs &#x201C;Return by Death&#x201D;. - <em>Plot Summary from the </em><span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga=\"[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://anitay.kinja.com/the-13-anime-of-spring-2016-you-should-be-watching-1777225329&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]\" href=\"http://anitay.kinja.com/the-13-anime-of-spring-2016-you-should-be-watching-1777225329\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>13 Anime of Spring 2016 You Should Be Watching Article</em></a></span> </p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong><em>Re:Zero </em>is for the most part a great show with an interesting premise, solid characters and unique structure<em>,</em> a show that would normally be pretty high on a list like this. The reason it&#x2019;s sitting as a dishonorable mention though is because it blew up on my face, irritating me to no end. The stupidity of the main character Subaru was an aspect of the show that always annoyed me, but as the show progressed Subaru became a worse and worse character, with every subsequent episode making me want to go into the show and beat him up more and more. The show has Subaru acting so stupid to the point that it breaks human comprehension, there&#x2019;s no way any person or character can be as dumb as he is. <em>Re:Zero</em> has it&#x2019;s strong points, but this fell off of my top list because it&#x2019;s literally making mad when I watch it, and that&#x2019;s a no go. The worst part is the show is doing this not because of the story elements like a good show may do, but because of the stupid of a character.

Well, except the fact that he can summon a Stand, a supernatural personification of his soul. Oh, and his father&#x2019;s grandson is around, this guy calling himself Jotaro Kujo, who has a Stand of his own. Right, and there&#x2019;s been this string of murders, involving some artifact called the Bow and Arrow, which is somehow connected to a man named Dio. It&#x2019;s probably important to mention that a bunch of enemy Stand users are popping up, too, most of them eager to attack Josuke and his friends with their insane abilities for one reason or another. Hm, that&#x2019;s not an ordinary life at all. Really, that&#x2019;s downright bizarre.

After watching <em>Macross Frontier</em>, a wonderful and serious space opera with a perfect mix of romance and music, I got to see this season&#x2019;s <em>Macross Delta</em> which I quite enjoyed even though it was a lot more silly generic anime stuff. The use of music was incredibly effective, the characters were enjoyable, the premise and the actual conflict was engaging, and of course seeing the fights were awesome. I&#x2019;m incredibly glad I&#x2019;ve been able to see this series and I really quite enjoyed this entry in it.</p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h105983\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>3. <em>Space Patrol Luluco</em></h3> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allowfullscreen class=\"core-inset lazyload\" data-recommended=\"false\" data-src=\"https://rockmandash12.kinja.com/ajax/inset/iframe?id=dm-x41c1o4\" frameborder=\"0\" id=\"dm-x41c1o4\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" scrolling=\"no\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitAllowFullScreen\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Made By:</strong> Studio Trigger<br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Genre:</strong> Action, Comedy, Space, <strong><em>JUSTICE</em></strong><br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Summary: </strong>Our titular Luluco lives in Ogikubo, where she lives with her father.

It&#x2019;s hard to for me to describe why many love this show so much, but every moment is pure bliss, enjoyable and relaxing to make your day all that much better. With funny character interactions, calming and enjoyable scenes, and entertaining moments of life that can&#x2019;t help but put a smile on your face, I fell in love with this show and so did many others. It&#x2019;s Slice of Life but it&#x2019;s the best kind of Slice of Life, one that immerses yourself into the relaxing world it has to offer.

While in a season of really solid shows, <em>Tanaka-kun</em> was the show that got the most enjoyment and laughs out of me due to it&#x2019;s fantastic cast and hilarious relationships. I loved every minute of it and throughout the season it was always my go to show whenever I wanted a good time. As more characters filtered in, the relationships got more interesting, the show got more jokes, and the show consistently got me excited and got me laughing. It was a great comedy from beginning to end and I had a lot of fun with it.</p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><em>You&#x2019;re reading Rockmandash Reviews, a blog focused on everything revolving Visual Novels, with stuff like Tech and Anime every now and then.
