Just seeing how the staff of the Kissusiou keep the inn running, the antics they try to pull to\n  get more customers, and how they deal with issues like large events is entertaining and kept me watching. On top of\n  that, they pair those with great characters, and it makes it a slice of life that stands out from the crowd.</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1248085436152323757\" title=\"1248085436152323757\" src=\"/static/fb1158a2d387f088ea61698e358e5e8c/1c72d/1248085436152323757.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/fb1158a2d387f088ea61698e358e5e8c/a80bd/1248085436152323757.jpg 148w,\n/static/fb1158a2d387f088ea61698e358e5e8c/1c91a/1248085436152323757.jpg 295w,\n/static/fb1158a2d387f088ea61698e358e5e8c/1c72d/1248085436152323757.jpg 590w,\n/static/fb1158a2d387f088ea61698e358e5e8c/a8a14/1248085436152323757.jpg 885w,\n/static/fb1158a2d387f088ea61698e358e5e8c/fbd2c/1248085436152323757.jpg 1180w,\n/static/fb1158a2d387f088ea61698e358e5e8c/eea4a/1248085436152323757.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">I can&#x2019;t emphasize this enough: The characters are superb in <em>Hanasaku Iroha</em>.\n  Ohana is probably the best main character I&#x2019;ve ever seen in a slice of life show, and the rest of the cast is equally\n  as great. The coming-of-age during the first episodes for Ohana was fantastic, and the themes she dealt with during\n  that time were amazing and the themes she dealt with, such as loneliness, facing reality, the struggle to fit in, and\n  dealing with the fact that effort doesn&#x2019;t equal results were amazing and made me able to relate to her. When she\n  changed herself, it was for the better: Ohana became a loud and overly optimistic lead who butted into many of the\n  other characters&#x2019; problems, yet this personality never got on my nerves unlike many characters of that nature. Her\n  quirks become strong points in the story and her actions, while annoying and reckless, always lead to the best\n  situations. The rest of the cast is just as dynamic and interesting: they have eccentric personality traits and they\n  all get fantastic development, with some of them even having whole episodes dedicated to developing it, with that info\n  actually helping the story. If I spent time discussing every character and what development they went through, I&#x2019;d be\n  here all day talking about them because of how well the character development is executed. It&#x2019;s what a good slice of\n  life should do: spending time to flesh out the characters in an enjoyable way.</p>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1248085436213579949\" title=\"1248085436213579949\" src=\"/static/1b18f4c0b74481b269adb1fbe132b6b3/1c72d/1248085436213579949.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/1b18f4c0b74481b269adb1fbe132b6b3/a80bd/1248085436213579949.jpg 148w,\n/static/1b18f4c0b74481b269adb1fbe132b6b3/1c91a/1248085436213579949.jpg 295w,\n/static/1b18f4c0b74481b269adb1fbe132b6b3/1c72d/1248085436213579949.jpg 590w,\n/static/1b18f4c0b74481b269adb1fbe132b6b3/a8a14/1248085436213579949.jpg 885w,\n/static/1b18f4c0b74481b269adb1fbe132b6b3/fbd2c/1248085436213579949.jpg 1180w,\n/static/1b18f4c0b74481b269adb1fbe132b6b3/eea4a/1248085436213579949.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">The interactions between the characters is one of the strong points of <em>Hanasaku\n  Iroha</em>&#x2019;s writing. The Kissusiou staff have some of the best chemistry I&#x2019;ve seen in anime, leading to some\n  interesting scenes. The bonds and feelings between the characters, along with their ideals of how they should live to\n  achieve a happy life is something that is extremely enjoyable to watch as they run their course. The idea that the\n  customer should always be the number one priority, the mentality of those who work in comparison to those who don&#x2019;t,\n  what one should dream for, what makes a successful team, the awkward relationship of a broken family that despises\n  each other, the relationships between friends and coworkers, and of course, the relationships that lead to love are\n  interesting, and engaging themes that were executed very well. Even the romantic sub-plot that felt shoehorned at\n  times was handled pretty well: never overwhelming the main story and still being entertaining.</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">If I had to say there was any flaws with this show, it has 2 of them: the middle parts of\n  the show where it falls into the typical event-of-the-week type of show, and the direction at the beginning which was\n  unclear. Both of these cause the plot and themes to falter, but the interesting interactions between the characters\n  kept me watching. Really, Mari Okada is a stellar writer and this is another example why. It had good pacing, and it\n  was entertaining throughout the show, especially at the end. It was a slice of life done right, and it shows that an\n  interesting setting with interesting characters can go a long way.</p>\n<h4 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h110172\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>Writing &#x2013; 9.25/10</h4>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 12.162162162162163%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAIAAADXZGvcAAAACXBIWXMAAA9gAAAPYAF6eEWNAAAAhUlEQVQI1wF6AIX/ANuOsOCeu+Kjv+Spw9yRst6WtuCdu9yRs9yRsuGhvdZ9pNZ+pdZ+pdR9o9+FsGOdW3O8dVawWnedauGBrgDbjK/qvdHlrsbrwdTmsMfpuc7rwdPotszjpcHpuc7XgKbWfaXWf6XVe6Pbi7BHnEZ4vXlVrVheoFncgazajVEjeahHqgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1248085436234760109\" title=\"1248085436234760109\" src=\"/static/f940bcacad2c9ce5cd90afa88aafb6ce/fcda8/1248085436234760109.png\" srcset=\"/static/f940bcacad2c9ce5cd90afa88aafb6ce/12f09/1248085436234760109.png 148w,\n/static/f940bcacad2c9ce5cd90afa88aafb6ce/e4a3f/1248085436234760109.png 295w,\n/static/f940bcacad2c9ce5cd90afa88aafb6ce/fcda8/1248085436234760109.png 590w,\n/static/f940bcacad2c9ce5cd90afa88aafb6ce/9be90/1248085436234760109.png 636w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1248085436276489389\" title=\"1248085436276489389\" src=\"/static/5043f9aa718a360ae304cbebeb22ac3a/1c72d/1248085436276489389.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/5043f9aa718a360ae304cbebeb22ac3a/a80bd/1248085436276489389.jpg 148w,\n/static/5043f9aa718a360ae304cbebeb22ac3a/1c91a/1248085436276489389.jpg 295w,\n/static/5043f9aa718a360ae304cbebeb22ac3a/1c72d/1248085436276489389.jpg 590w,\n/static/5043f9aa718a360ae304cbebeb22ac3a/c60f3/1248085436276489389.jpg 636w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">I can pretty much copy and paste this segment for PA Works shows at this point: it’s a\nbeautiful show, just like everything they have made.

They were my personal\nfavorite parts of the show visually as they make the city look amazing, yet they captured the look and feel of the\ncity from Ohana’s perspective. That’s a theme continues on; they really capture what a countryside would look like\n(Probably because It’s inspired by a real place), and they capture the feel of the countryside with the great\nlighting, insane detail, and the vivid greenery. However, there is a slight con due to this: the visuals don’t tend to\npop out that much in the show nearly as much as something like <span><a class=\"sc-1out364-0 hMndXN sc-145m8ut-0 gIacKn js_link\" data-ga='[[\"Embedded Url\",\"Internal link\",\"http://tay.kotaku.com/rockmandash-reviews-nagi-no-asukara-anime-1567969970\",{\"metric25\":1}]]' href=\"http://tay.kotaku.com/rockmandash-reviews-nagi-no-asukara-anime-1567969970\"><em>Nagi no Asukara</em></a></span><em> </em>becauseit’s\nmore subdued and realistic, which is kind of a shame, but it helps the mood at the same time. </p></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">I normally don&#x2019;t really touch on them, but I thought that the character designs in <em>Hanasaku Iroha</em> were quite great because the characters have designs that work with their personalities.

Once you finally notice the soundtrack, you&#x2019;ll be pleasantly surprised as it has well composed tracks, it utilizes a wide variety of instruments, it&#x2019;s pleasing to the ear and it&#x2019;s pretty great overall. As for voice acting, it&#x2019;s pretty solid, but I&#x2019;m not really an expert when it comes to voice acting so I can&#x2019;t say much about it.</p> <h4 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h110174\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>Sound - 8.5/10</h4> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 12.162162162162163%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAIAAADXZGvcAAAACXBIWXMAAA9gAAAPYAF6eEWNAAAAhUlEQVQI1wF6AIX/AN6Yt+OowuGhvdyQsd6auOKkv+CgveGfvOKlwOKmweOow+KivuGgvOGkvuCGsGOdW3O8dVawWnedauGBrgDkq8XouM7rwtTmssnotczlr8fotczipsDrwNTswdTqvtLpu8/pus/hoL3biq9HnEZ4vXlVrVheoFncgaymHFTDGaS19wAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span> <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1248085436352335533\" title=\"1248085436352335533\" src=\"/static/0cf139c4ecd72553f0abfc4ca48c753c/fcda8/1248085436352335533.png\" srcset=\"/static/0cf139c4ecd72553f0abfc4ca48c753c/12f09/1248085436352335533.png 148w, /static/0cf139c4ecd72553f0abfc4ca48c753c/e4a3f/1248085436352335533.png 295w, /static/0cf139c4ecd72553f0abfc4ca48c753c/fcda8/1248085436352335533.png 590w, /static/0cf139c4ecd72553f0abfc4ca48c753c/9be90/1248085436352335533.png 636w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\"> </span> </div>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1248085436394128301\" title=\"1248085436394128301\" src=\"/static/87681cd365c21c6e9834729982300b22/1c72d/1248085436394128301.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/87681cd365c21c6e9834729982300b22/a80bd/1248085436394128301.jpg 148w,\n/static/87681cd365c21c6e9834729982300b22/1c91a/1248085436394128301.jpg 295w,\n/static/87681cd365c21c6e9834729982300b22/1c72d/1248085436394128301.jpg 590w,\n/static/87681cd365c21c6e9834729982300b22/a8a14/1248085436394128301.jpg 885w,\n/static/87681cd365c21c6e9834729982300b22/fbd2c/1248085436394128301.jpg 1180w,\n/static/87681cd365c21c6e9834729982300b22/eea4a/1248085436394128301.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Normally, with Okada stories, I have strong opinions on the stories she writes.\nWith <em>Hanasaku Iroha</em>, that’s not really the case. I’ve been saying it throughout the review; this show is very\nsubtle and what it’s trying to do, and this subtlety is something that makes me appreciate the show after the fact\nmore than while watching it. It gives it a feeling that this show was more planned than others, and I liked that.\nHowever, this can be a flaw; the show was thoroughly enjoyable and found it to be great… but it doesn’t have the\npassion I usually feel when dealing with Mari Okada works. I missed that, and I’m not exactly sure what to think of\nthe change, but I don’t think that’s the point with this show. This was a show that set out to be an enjoyable slice\nof life and a feel good show, which it certainly does.
