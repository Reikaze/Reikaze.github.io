Like most people, in my opinion, the Summer 2016 season of anime wasn&#x2019;t all that great: no standout shows, and very few shows that compel you to watch every week. Hell, during the middle of the season, I had to stop following as much but usually when this happens, I&#x2019;m still following a fair amount of shows week by week. This time, there was maybe one or two, much lower than what I&#x2019;m used to seeing. That being said, unlike the sentiment online that believed Re:Zero was the only interesting show of the season, there was still a lot of great shows, some truly hidden gems. That&#x2019;s what this list is going to have!</p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h102139\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>Rules </h3> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span> <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"hoqr0ntzmr6yp0uajbcg\" title=\"hoqr0ntzmr6yp0uajbcg\" src=\"/static/164ec83a72ef7e6f202904bf737b1c1e/1c72d/hoqr0ntzmr6yp0uajbcg.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/164ec83a72ef7e6f202904bf737b1c1e/a80bd/hoqr0ntzmr6yp0uajbcg.jpg 148w, /static/164ec83a72ef7e6f202904bf737b1c1e/1c91a/hoqr0ntzmr6yp0uajbcg.jpg 295w, /static/164ec83a72ef7e6f202904bf737b1c1e/1c72d/hoqr0ntzmr6yp0uajbcg.jpg 590w, /static/164ec83a72ef7e6f202904bf737b1c1e/a8a14/hoqr0ntzmr6yp0uajbcg.jpg 885w, /static/164ec83a72ef7e6f202904bf737b1c1e/fbd2c/hoqr0ntzmr6yp0uajbcg.jpg 1180w, /static/164ec83a72ef7e6f202904bf737b1c1e/0f98f/hoqr0ntzmr6yp0uajbcg.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\"> </span> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">My rules of this list are simple: if it aired/released this season, it can go on this list. I don&#x2019;t see the point in only giving a show one chance during it&#x2019;s airing season, and this is my list so I&#x2019;ll list my favorite shows regardless of what season it started on. If this means that one show hogs the top spot for 2 seasons, than good for that show! If it&#x2019;s an OVA or movie that came out during the duration of the season I fell in love with, then it may be there. Also, I think that the seasonal split is arbitrary and unnecessary, so it&#x2019;s completely gone here. Sorry about that, but that&#x2019;s how I&#x2019;m doing it.<br><br><br>Just an FYI, the placement of the show in the list is mostly based on my experience and enjoyment of the work, so if you&#x2019;re wondering why something isn&#x2019;t where you think it should be or you can&#x2019;t really tell via the justification, that&#x2019;s probably why. Keep in mind, just because a show is lower on the list doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s bad - all of these are great, and a lower placement isn&#x2019;t a mark against the show, at this point it&#x2019;s nearly all personal preference.</p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h102140\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>Honorable Mention: <strong><em>Fate/kaleid liner Prisma&#x2606;Illya 3rei!!</em></strong>&#xA0;</h3> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNzi-3NG1Rk\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"pNzi-3NG1Rk\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://pNzi-3NG1Rk\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-pNzi-3NG1Rk\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Anime Made By: </strong>Silver Link<br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Genre: </strong>Magical Girl, Action, Fantasy</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Summary: </strong>Illya and the gang have finished their battle against the heroic spirit residing in the eighth class card.

I really loved 3rei, but I didn&#x2019;t watch all of 3rei, thus HMs for you. This is not because I didn&#x2019;t like it, but because I was already caught up in the manga and retreading stories in different mediums can be annoying to see for everything, even if the equidistant versions are rather similar (though the anime amps up the fanservice.). If you&#x2019;re a fan of fate, the twists that this does on F/SN are fascinating and makes for a trilling ride. </p> </div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h102141\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>7. <em>Planetarian</em> </h3> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u_uy1yrP7gI\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"u_uy1yrP7gI\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://u_uy1yrP7gI\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-u_uy1yrP7gI\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Anime Made By:</strong> David Productions</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Genre: </strong>Drama, Sci-Fi</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Summary: </strong> Years after humanity lead their species and the planet along with them into a state of near extinction, men known as &#x201C;Junkers&#x201D; traverse the lands in use of anything useful.

It&#x2019;s short and sweet, being only five OVAs, but unlike most VNs,<em> Planetarian</em> is linear and short, making an adaptation possible in the fashion they did, and it was done rather effectively. <em>Planetarian</em> maximizes its limits, being a very focused and well-executed work that is almost movie-like in its storytelling, a great direction for a Key work. It enables them to do what people love about them, which works well with what it tries to do, which in my opinion is being a condensed version of everything great about Key (the makers of works like <em>Clannad</em>), without any of the negatives. The show provides the great parts of slice of life without the fluff, it&#x2019;s engaging to watch throughout, and as one would expect from a Key work, it packs plenty of feelz. It&#x2019;s a fantastic ride, and it&#x2019;s definitely one to check out, especially now that is available in an animated form.</p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h102142\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>6. <em>Alderamin in the Sky</em></h3> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wm07R0s--nI\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"wm07R0s--nI\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://wm07R0s--nI\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-wm07R0s--nI\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Anime Made By: </strong>Madhouse<br></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Genre: </strong> Military, Fantasy, Adventure</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Summary: </strong>In a militaristic fantasy world, the kind of world where soldiers use guns powered by adorable, magic little spirtes, the Katjvarna Empire is locked in a struggle with the Kioka Republic.

The premise may not be the most original, but thanks to madhouse&#x2019;s magic touch, they made it compelling to watch, telling a military drama tale that shows bonds of characters and the horrors of war. It&#x2019;s fantasy setting allows for an interesting blend of feudal and modern tactics, and the characters in this work are enjoyable to see while being engaging to learn about, making for a solid show throughout.

It&#x2019;s worth a watch, but just warning you that if you can&#x2019;t really handle fanservice in anime, this is a no go. <em>Too bad the manga falls downhill after this.</em></p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h102145\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>4. <em>Mob Psycho 100</em></h3> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N9-EdKLEuuA\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"N9-EdKLEuuA\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://N9-EdKLEuuA\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-N9-EdKLEuuA\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Anime Made By: </strong>BONES</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"> <strong>Genre: </strong> Comedy, Supernatural</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Summary: </strong>Shigeo Kageyama (nicknamed Mob) is just a normal, quiet, shy, physically unimpressive, try-hard sort of kid.

If you enjoyed the humor and style of that show, you&#x2019;ll be right at home with Mob Psycho, and it made every moment fun to watch. It&#x2019;s also a showcase of animation from BONES, who took ONE&#x2019;s lackluster art and made it into something stylistic and spectacular, a feast for the eyes. Definitely watch the OP and EDs, they&#x2019;re exapmles of artists pushing the limits of the medium, and it&#x2019;s absolutely fascinating to see.</p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h102146\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>3. <em>91 Days</em></h3> <div class=\"ooo3c9-0 PpIMM align--bleed has-video media-large video-embed embed-frame\"><span class=\"flex-video widescreen\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EUA0rOQJfP0\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe><span class=\"js_recommend\" data-chomp-id=\"EUA0rOQJfP0\" data-recommend-id=\"youtube://EUA0rOQJfP0\" data-recommended=\"false\" id=\"youtube-EUA0rOQJfP0\"></span></span></div><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Anime Made By: </strong>Shuka</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"> <strong>Genre: </strong>Action, Drama, Historical</p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Summary: </strong>Angelo Lagusa is just your average boy living in Prohibition-era America, complete with loving parents and an adorable little brother.

On the way home (and right after his parents decide to stop sending him money), a man named Yoake Ryo stands in his path. Ryo is a member of the ReLIFE Laboratory, and informs Arata that he has been selected as a ReLIFE test subject. Should Arata choose to accept this offer, all his living expenses will be paid, and, depending on how well this experiment goes, he could even be hooked up with a job! All he has to do is take the ReLIFE drug and go back to high school for a year.

Crunchyroll, for some odd reason, decided to release this show all at the beginning of the season, and I love them for it, enabling me to marathon a show that perfectly matches my preferences. I&#x2019;m a sucker for romantic dramas, and to see one of them done so well in this fashion is something I really enjoyed. ReLife, more than anything, is about life, giving one a second chance while looking at what makes this tick, and this fuels a thrilling ride of character interactions that allow the viewer to get more and more attached to the cast as they watch. Along with that, ReLife has a great cast of characters with fascinating personalities, and plus, it&#x2019;s funny, keeping the show always engaging to watch. Definitely a great time, and I can&#x2019;t wait for more.</p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h102148\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>1. <em>Kimi no Na wa.

That is, because during AX 2016, I was able to watch the world premiere of this movie and my mind was completely blown. While I always appreciated Shinkai&#x2019;s works, I would be what most would describe as a Shinkai Skeptic because I would generally paint a negative picture on them when I talked about them. This is because I never really was engaged with them and the story they had to tell, but <em>Kimi no Na wa</em>... had my crying in my seat. Every moment was engaging, every moment was beautful, and most importantly, I was actually enjoying it, unlike so many of his works.
