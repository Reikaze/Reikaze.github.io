If it aired/released this season, it can go on this list. I don’t see the point in only giving\n  a show one chance during it’s airing season, and this is my list so I’ll list my favorite shows regardless of what\n  season it started on. If this means that one show hogs the top spot for 2 seasons, than good for that show! If it’s an\n  OVA or movie that came out during the duration of the season I fell in love with, then it may be there. Also, I think\n  that the seasonal split is arbitrary and unnecessary, so it’s completely gone here. Sorry about that, but that’s how\n  I’m doing it. </p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong><em>*Also, a note to the reader* -</em></strong><em> </em>The\n  honorable mentions on this list is a bit different than a typical honorable mentions, and probably not in a good way:\n  Normally, HMs are solely shows that weren’t good enough to make the list, barely scraping by because of quality, but\n  the shows sitting in my HMs for Spring 2015 are a list of shows that emphasize my personal biases, shows that I love\n  to the point that they must be mentioned regardless of quality, but ended up being not as great as expected. that\n  being said, continue on!</p>\n<hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h4 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h7692\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a><strong>HM#1.<em>\n  Punch Line</em></strong></h4>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1341053165083161744\" title=\"1341053165083161744\" src=\"/static/15f752413c192e00ded0dd0a426be875/1c72d/1341053165083161744.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/15f752413c192e00ded0dd0a426be875/a80bd/1341053165083161744.jpg 148w,\n/static/15f752413c192e00ded0dd0a426be875/1c91a/1341053165083161744.jpg 295w,\n/static/15f752413c192e00ded0dd0a426be875/1c72d/1341053165083161744.jpg 590w,\n/static/15f752413c192e00ded0dd0a426be875/a8a14/1341053165083161744.jpg 885w,\n/static/15f752413c192e00ded0dd0a426be875/fbd2c/1341053165083161744.jpg 1180w,\n/static/15f752413c192e00ded0dd0a426be875/eea4a/1341053165083161744.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Description: </strong>If he sees underwear, humanity will be\n  destroyed!? An original anime series from the noitaminA block, Punch Line centers on Yuuta Iridatsu, a high school\n  student, with a peculiar habit.

Eventually, Yuuta decides to unlock the secrets to\n  why Earth will be destroyed and tries to save it! <em>- Plot Description from MAL</em></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Zero Escape Lite! Written by Kotaro\n  Uchikoshi (AKA my favorite writer ever), I came to <em>Punch line</em> with confused expectations and came out with...\n  confused expectations. <em>Punch Line</em> was a weird combination of the fanservice that it presented originally,\n  combined with the typical Uchikoshi aspects of SciFi, plot twists, solid characters, etc. It&#x2019;s playing of expectations\n  kinda backfired with me though, as episode one presented itself to be another FLCL, then it kinda died halfway with VN\n  adaptation-like pacing to shift itself over to a more traditional Uchikoshi experience. A hybrid of the two would have\n  been way awesome, but as is, it&#x2019;s a fun enough show that handled itself well enough.

Considering that I adored S1, how could I not love Season 2? Simple: KoS 2 isn&#x2019;t the Sidonia I fell in\n  love with, the Sidonia that really captured the &#x201C;coolness&#x201D; of Japanese SciFi. I admired Sidonia S1 for what it did\n  with it&#x2019;s realistic and serious execution, the brilliant and extremely interesting world, the extremely gripping\n  narrative, and an awesome tone that keeps you interested in a story... But they took that and threw that Space SciFi\n  Mecha that I fell in love with and replaced it with an extremely out of place Rom Com in space, with a more fitting\n  title being <em>&#x201C;I Can&#x2019;t Believe My Giant Half-Monster Mecha Girlfriend Is This Cute.&#x201D; </em><small>(Thanks\n    Richard!)</small></p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">That being said, It&#x2019;s not a bad show by any means, still being entertaining and\n  having its moments, but top 10 of this year material this is not, and its not even top 5 of this season. A lot of the\n  issues it has are issues with the manga, being too information light (which were made worse due to it being anime) and\n  not really having a solid direction for this aspect, but man, this arc had too much romance, not enough SciFi... and\n  this is coming from a person who&#x2019;s favorite genre is romance. It lost everything Season 1 had, losing all sorts of\n  seriousness, tension, world building and Hard SciFi realism that this show did so well... leaving us with... a\n  romance... that... doesn&#x2019;t... fit. :(<br></p>\n<hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h4 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h7694\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>HM#3:<em>\n  Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works</em></h4>\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1341053165566082704\" title=\"1341053165566082704\" src=\"/static/4596ac4d0a295ede5206af447623cea9/1c72d/1341053165566082704.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/4596ac4d0a295ede5206af447623cea9/a80bd/1341053165566082704.jpg 148w,\n/static/4596ac4d0a295ede5206af447623cea9/1c91a/1341053165566082704.jpg 295w,\n/static/4596ac4d0a295ede5206af447623cea9/1c72d/1341053165566082704.jpg 590w,\n/static/4596ac4d0a295ede5206af447623cea9/a8a14/1341053165566082704.jpg 885w,\n/static/4596ac4d0a295ede5206af447623cea9/fbd2c/1341053165566082704.jpg 1180w,\n/static/4596ac4d0a295ede5206af447623cea9/48f41/1341053165566082704.jpg 1997w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Description: </strong><em>Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works</em>\n  follows Emiya Shirou as he is dragged into a Fight-to-the-death tournament called The Fifth Holy Grail War, where\n  people known as masters fight with Heroes throughout history, known as servants, for a chance to get the Holy Grail,\n  which grants their wishes.

Really, I hyped it too much, and I felt the burn the whole way through because of it\n  due to the with wonky pacing, rough execution of the story, a joke of a soundtrack that fails to do anything to the\n  show, and overall rather meh execution that turned my favorite route of one of my favorite Visual Novels into a show\n  that rarely managed to engage me at all, a show I tried to love, but couldn&#x2019;t. Yes, it looks absolutely beautiful with\n  some of the best fight scenes and scenery I have seen in this medium, and Yes, the last few episodes (especially\n  episode 20) were just great, but those didn&#x2019;t save it for me, the show that looked flawless on paper but came out to\n  be a pretty messy show.

One day, he accidentally falls from a flight\n  of stairs onto Urara Shiraishi, the ace student of the school. Yamada wakes up to find that he has swapped bodies with\n  her! The two try to reverse the change and discover that kissing triggers the body swap. On the suggestion of student\n  council vice-president Toranosuke Miyamura, they revive the Supernatural Studies Club.

With no real tragic flaws crippling the show,\n  <em>Yamada-Kun</em> was a great time, as the Body switching and an assortment of colorful, interesting characters\n  really do a great job engaging the audience, and I eventually just binged through the manga after I finished this\n  season because of that. Yes, the show is nothing special presentation wise, nothing special story wise, nothing\n  special... at all... but the show is just so entertaining, with great writing, great characters (Shiraishi really\n  taking the cake here) and a premise that works really well that I couldn&#x2019;t help but put it on this list.

These are romances that couldn&#x2019;t be further apart, but both of them are stellar twists on the typical formula that really shouldn&#x2019;t be missed. shows that shine with a stellar execution that brings out the best of what they are offering. </p> <hr class=\"gcp5ez-0 hKlTiw\"><h3 class=\"sc-1bwb26k-1 fvCjqJ\" id=\"h7699\"><a class=\"js_header-anchor\" id></a>1.<em> Kekkai Sensen (Blood Blockade Battlefront)</em></h3> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"> <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.08108108108109%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span> <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"1341053166309351824\" title=\"1341053166309351824\" src=\"/static/cb458b305b3f0e56ae89dade1ecae690/1c72d/1341053166309351824.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/cb458b305b3f0e56ae89dade1ecae690/a80bd/1341053166309351824.jpg 148w, /static/cb458b305b3f0e56ae89dade1ecae690/1c91a/1341053166309351824.jpg 295w, /static/cb458b305b3f0e56ae89dade1ecae690/1c72d/1341053166309351824.jpg 590w, /static/cb458b305b3f0e56ae89dade1ecae690/a8a14/1341053166309351824.jpg 885w, /static/cb458b305b3f0e56ae89dade1ecae690/72e01/1341053166309351824.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\"> </span> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Plot Description: </strong>A breach between Earth and the netherworlds has opened up over the city of New York, trapping New Yorkers and creatures from other dimensions in an impenetrable bubble. They&#x2019;ve lived together for years, in a world of crazy crime sci-fi sensibilities. Now someone is threatening to sever the bubble, and a group of stylish superhumans is working to keep it from happening. <em>- Plot Description from MAL</em></p><p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\"><strong>Justification &amp; Thoughts: </strong>Seriously, ask yourself this... Could there be anything else topping this list? I mean, really... written by the genius who brought us the classic<em> Trigun</em>, <em>Kekkai Sensen</em> is an amazing episodic show that does almost everything right, a show that will hook you in like no other show really can. It&#x2019;s a show that presents an anazing world, a vibrant, extremely well crafted Monster New York that drags you in with interesting changes to reality, stylization that keeps you constantly engaged, and an atmosphere that makes this setting feeling more alive than pretty much any other setting out there. It doesn&#x2019;t just end there either: pretty much everything about this show deserves praise, from the extremely memorable and awesome characters (Zapp!) to the brilliant presentation (Jazz!) and the absolutely engaging scenarios that happen throughout this story (Chess!). This is a show that I admire as it is the type of show I always look for, being experience first by showing you some absolutely interesting, engaging and amazing scenarios that can either hit hard (Feelz about hamburgers... ;-;), be really entertaining (That guy where all the bad things happen XD) or just be absolutely outstanding to the point that every aspect about this show is just brilliant and and a joy to watch, showing how episodic shows are done right. Cheers to <em>Kekkai Sensen</em>, AOTY candidate for 2015... you were amazing.</p> <p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Also, the ED is just bonkers great, one of the best I&#x2019;ve seen.
